# Save the Cat: A Writer's Guide

## Overview

Save the Cat is a story structure framework created by screenwriter Blake Snyder in his 2005 book "Save the Cat! The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need." While originally developed for screenplays, the method has been widely adopted by novelists, short story writers, and other storytellers.

The name "Save the Cat" comes from Snyder's belief that the protagonist should do something likable early on (like saving a cat) to make the audience care about them. The approach is known for its accessible 15-beat structure that divides stories into clear, manageable segments within a three-act framework.

What makes Save the Cat distinctive is its precise beat placement, attention to emotional impact, and focus on satisfying genre conventions while maintaining a universal structural foundation.

## The 15 Beats

### Act 1: The Setup

1. **Opening Image** (1%)
   - First impression of your story world and tone
   - Often presents a visual that represents the protagonist's starting state
   - Establishes the status quo and hints at the theme
   - Should contrast with the final image

2. **Theme Stated** (5%)
   - Someone (usually not the protagonist) states what the story is really about
   - Often disguised as throwaway dialogue
   - Poses the thematic question that will be answered by the end
   - The protagonist typically doesn't understand this truth yet

3. **Setup** (1-10%)
   - Introduces the main characters, their world, and their problems
   - Establishes what's missing in the protagonist's life
   - Plants seeds for future payoffs and subplots
   - Shows the "before" picture of the protagonist's life
   - Reveals the protagonist's flaws that need to be overcome

4. **Catalyst** (10%)
   - The inciting incident that disrupts the status quo
   - An external event that forces the protagonist to respond
   - Sets the main plot in motion
   - Often something unexpected or unwanted

5. **Debate** (10-20%)
   - Protagonist questions whether to pursue the journey
   - Shows reluctance, fear, or denial
   - Raises the stakes and clarifies the risks
   - Often structured as "Should I go?" or "How can I proceed?"
   - The last moment of hesitation before commitment

### Act 2: Confrontation

6. **Break Into Two** (20%)
   - Protagonist makes a definitive choice to engage with the problem
   - Leaves the old world behind (physically or metaphorically)
   - Enters the "antithesis world" or new situation
   - Point of no return that ends Act 1

7. **B Story** (22%)
   - Introduction of a new relationship or subplot
   - Often provides counterpoint to the main story
   - Typically involves the "helper" character who aids in the protagonist's transformation
   - Usually contains the love story or represents the thematic argument
   - Will provide the solution to the A Story later

8. **Fun and Games** (20-50%)
   - The "promise of the premise" – delivers what the audience came to see
   - Series of entertaining episodes showing the protagonist in the new world
   - Usually the most marketable, trailer-worthy moments
   - Exploration of the concept without pushing the central conflict too hard
   - Provides breathing room between major plot points

9. **Midpoint** (50%)
   - Central turning point that raises the stakes
   - Either a false victory (everything seems great) or false defeat (everything seems terrible)
   - Changes the protagonist's goal or approach
   - Often includes a ticking clock element
   - The fun ends, and the consequences begin

10. **Bad Guys Close In** (50-75%)
    - External antagonistic forces intensify
    - Internal dissent, doubts, and character flaws emerge
    - Alliances begin to break down
    - Increasing complications and higher stakes
    - The "fun and games" consequences become apparent

11. **All Is Lost** (75%)
    - Protagonist experiences a major setback or crisis
    - Often includes a death (literal or symbolic)
    - The opposite moment from the midpoint (if midpoint was up, this is down)
    - "Whiff of death" – sense that all hope is gone
    - Darkest moment before transformation

12. **Dark Night of the Soul** (75-80%)
    - Protagonist's moment of deepest despair
    - Loses faith in themselves, others, or their mission
    - Confronts their greatest fear or flaw
    - Mourns what has been lost
    - Sets up the breakthrough that enables the final solution

### Act 3: Resolution

13. **Break Into Three** (80%)
    - Protagonist has an epiphany that provides a new solution
    - Often triggered by something from the B Story
    - Synthesis of what they've learned with who they were
    - Resolves to take on the antagonist with newfound understanding
    - Transition to the final act and conclusion

14. **Finale** (80-99%)
    - Protagonist executes the new plan
    - Proves they've changed by acting differently than before
    - Often structured as a multi-step sequence showing mastery
    - Resolves all storylines and answers all questions
    - Antagonist is defeated, and the central problem is solved

15. **Final Image** (99-100%)
    - Closing visual that demonstrates how much has changed
    - Mirror or contrast to the opening image
    - Shows the new world order or protagonist's transformation
    - Reinforces the theme
    - Leaves a lasting impression on the audience

## Practical Application

### Planning Your Story

1. **Identify Your Genre**: Determine which of the 10 story types best fits your idea
2. **Create a Logline**: One-sentence summary capturing protagonist, conflict, and stakes

5. **Create a Board**: Visualize your story with index cards or sticky notes for each scene
6. **Track Transformations**: Ensure your character changes meaningfully through the story

### Common Adaptations for Novels

1. **Expanded Beats**: Some beats (like Setup or Fun and Games) may take more pages
2. **Multiple POVs**: Each viewpoint character can have their own beat sheet
3. **Subplot Integration**: Novels typically have more subplots than screenplays
4. **Percentages vs. Page Numbers**: Use story percentages rather than page counts
5. **Internal Focus**: More emphasis on internal thoughts and emotions

### Implementation Tips

1. **Start with Endings**: Know your final image before writing the opening image
2. **Focus on Transformation**: Ensure your protagonist changes meaningfully
3. **Use the "Pope in the Pool"**: Deliver exposition during interesting or distracting scenes
4. **Double Bump Emotional Moments**: Important emotional beats should be hit twice
5. **Maintain Audience Empathy**: Ensure readers remain connected to the protagonist
