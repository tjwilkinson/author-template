# Screenplay Writing: Structure and Format Guide

## Overview

A screenplay is a blueprint for a film or television show, containing dialogue, action, and visual directions. Unlike novels or short stories, screenplays follow strict formatting conventions and structural guidelines designed to translate narrative into visual storytelling. This guide covers both the technical aspects of screenplay format and the principles of effective screenplay structure.

The dual nature of screenplays—as both creative works and technical documents—requires writers to balance artistic expression with industry standards. By mastering screenplay mechanics and dramatic principles, you can create compelling scripts that communicate your vision clearly to directors, actors, and production teams.

## Screenplay Format Essentials

### Page Layout
- **Paper Size**: 8.5" x 11" (US Letter)
- **Margins**: 1.5" left margin, 1" right margin, 1" top and bottom margins
- **Font**: 12-point Courier or Courier New (fixed-width font)
- **Page Numbering**: Upper right corner, except page 1
- **Binding**: Three-hole punched, brass fasteners (physical copies)
- **Page Count**: Feature films typically 90-120 pages (1 page ≈ 1 minute of screen time)

### Script Elements

#### Scene Headings (Slug Lines)
- **Format**: INT./EXT. LOCATION - TIME
- **Example**: INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
- **Purpose**: Indicates where and when a scene takes place
- **Always CAPITALIZED**
- **May include modifiers**: CONTINUOUS, LATER, SAME TIME, etc.

#### Action (Description)
- **Format**: Left-aligned, single-spaced text
- **Purpose**: Describes what the viewer sees on screen
- **Style**: Present tense, active voice, visual language
- **Length**: Brief paragraphs (3-4 lines maximum)
- **Capitalization**: Introduce CHARACTERS and important SOUNDS or PROPS in caps

#### Character Names
- **Format**: Center-aligned, ALL CAPS
- **Position**: 3.7" from left edge of page
- **Extensions**: (V.O.) for voiceover, (O.S.) for off-screen, (CONT'D) for dialogue continued after action

#### Dialogue
- **Format**: Center-aligned block, narrower than action text
- **Position**: 2.5" from left edge of page, extending 2.5" to the right
- **Purpose**: Words spoken by characters

#### Parentheticals
- **Format**: (in parentheses) below character name or within dialogue
- **Purpose**: Brief performance directions or clarity notes
- **Use sparingly**: Only when necessary for understanding

#### Transitions
- **Format**: Right-aligned, CAPITALIZED
- **Examples**: CUT TO:, DISSOLVE TO:, FADE OUT.
- **Usage**: Use sparingly, primarily for significant shifts

#### Shot Specifications
- **Format**: CAPITALIZED within action
- **Examples**: CLOSE ON, ANGLE ON, POV
- **Caution**: Use minimally unless directing; focus on what's seen, not how to shoot it

### Special Formatting

#### Montages
```
MONTAGE - TITLE (if needed)

-- Character does something.

-- Character does something else.

-- Final beat of the montage.

END MONTAGE
```

#### Intercut Scenes
```
INTERCUT BETWEEN:

INT. LOCATION ONE - DAY

Character One does something.

INT. LOCATION TWO - DAY

Character Two responds.
```

#### Flashbacks
```
FLASHBACK TO:

INT. LOCATION - PAST TIME INDICATOR

Action from the past.

BACK TO PRESENT
```

## Screenplay Structure

### The Three-Act Structure

#### Act 1: Setup (Pages 1-30, approx. 25%)
- **Establish**: World, protagonist, tone
- **Introduce**: Central conflict and stakes
- **Present**: Inciting incident (approx. p.10-15)
- **End with**: First plot point/point of no return (approx. p.25-30)

#### Act 2: Confrontation (Pages 30-90, approx. 50%)
- **First Half**: Protagonist reacts to new situation
- **Midpoint**: Major revelation or shift (approx. p.55-60)
- **Second Half**: Protagonist becomes proactive
- **End with**: Second plot point/lowest moment (approx. p.85-90)

#### Act 3: Resolution (Pages 90-120, approx. 25%)
- **Begin with**: New determination/plan
- **Build to**: Climactic sequence
- **Resolve**: Main conflict
- **Show**: New normal/character transformation

### Key Structural Elements

#### Inciting Incident
- **Purpose**: Disrupts the protagonist's status quo
- **Timing**: Around page 10-15
- **Function**: Sets the main story in motion
- **Example**: Luke discovers Leia's message in R2-D2 (Star Wars)

#### First Plot Point
- **Purpose**: Fully commits protagonist to the main conflict
- **Timing**: End of Act 1, around page 25-30
- **Function**: Point of no return; status quo is permanently altered
- **Example**: Neo takes the red pill (The Matrix)

#### Midpoint
- **Purpose**: Raises stakes and shifts the direction
- **Timing**: Middle of Act 2, around page 55-60
- **Function**: Often involves false victory or false defeat
- **Example**: Clarice and Lecter's quid pro quo agreement (The Silence of the Lambs)

#### Second Plot Point
- **Purpose**: Final obstacle before climactic resolution
- **Timing**: End of Act 2, around page 85-90
- **Function**: Often the darkest moment; forces protagonist to make final choice
- **Example**: Roy Batty catches Deckard hanging from building (Blade Runner)

#### Climax
- **Purpose**: Resolves the central conflict
- **Timing**: Last quarter of the script
- **Function**: Tests protagonist's growth/change
- **Example**: Andy's escape revealed (The Shawshank Redemption)

### Alternative Structural Approaches

#### Five-Act Structure
Traditional dramatic structure used by Shakespeare and some TV shows:
1. **Exposition**: Setup and introduction
2. **Rising Action**: Complications develop
3. **Climax**: Turning point
4. **Falling Action**: Consequences unfold
5. **Denouement**: Resolution

#### Sequence Approach
Eight 10-15 page sequences, each with its own dramatic question:
1. **Sequence A**: Setup
2. **Sequence B**: First act turn
3. **Sequence C**: First half of Act 2 begins
4. **Sequence D**: Midpoint approaches
5. **Sequence E**: Second half of Act 2 begins
6. **Sequence F**: Act 2 culminates
7. **Sequence G**: Act 3 begins
8. **Sequence H**: Resolution

#### Non-Linear Structure
- Manipulates chronology for dramatic effect
- Requires clear indicators of time shifts
- Examples: Pulp Fiction, Memento, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

## Character Development in Screenplays

### Protagonist Design
- **Want vs. Need**: External goal vs. internal requirement for growth
- **Fatal Flaw**: Character weakness that must be overcome
- **Arc**: The change journey from beginning to end
- **Agency**: Active role in driving the story forward

### Character Entrances
- **First Impression**: How character is introduced visually
- **Characteristic Moment**: Action that defines their personality
- **Economical Description**: Brief but vivid physical attributes and essence

### Character Functions
- **Protagonist**: Main character whose journey we follow
- **Antagonist**: Character or force opposing the protagonist's goal
- **Mentor**: Guides the protagonist
- **Ally**: Supports the protagonist's journey
- **Threshold Guardian**: Presents tests or obstacles
- **Shape-shifter**: Character with questionable loyalty
- **Trickster**: Provides comic relief or chaos

## Dialogue Techniques

### Effective Screenplay Dialogue
- **Brevity**: Generally shorter than real speech
- **Subtext**: Meaning beneath the words
- **Voice**: Distinctive patterns for each character
- **Conflict**: Creates tension even in casual exchanges
- **Function**: Advances plot, reveals character, or delivers exposition

### Dialogue Don'ts
- **On-the-nose**: Too direct or obvious
- **Exposition dumps**: Unnatural information delivery
- **Redundancy**: Stating what visuals already show
- **Monologuing**: Unrealistically long speeches
- **Same voice**: All characters sounding identical

### Dialogue Format Tips
- Break long speeches into smaller chunks with action
- Use ellipses (...) for trailing off
- Use dashes (--) for interruptions
- Indicate emphasis sparingly with italics

## Visual Storytelling

### Show, Don't Tell
- **Visual Revelations**: Reveal information through action, not dialogue
- **Emotional States**: Express feelings through behavior rather than statements
- **Relationships**: Demonstrate connections through interactions

### Creating Visual Interest
- **Varied Locations**: Change settings to maintain visual engagement
- **Activity**: Characters doing things while talking
- **Visual Metaphors**: Using imagery to reinforce themes
- **Scene Dynamics**: Changing spatial relationships during scenes

### Action Line Techniques
- **Emphasize the visual**: Describe what can be seen and heard
- **Active verbs**: Create immediate, dynamic imagery
- **White space**: Use shorter paragraphs for readability and pace
- **Rhythm**: Vary sentence length for emotional effect

## Common Screenplay Mistakes
