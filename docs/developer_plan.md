# Author Project Template Development Plan

This plan outlines the remaining tasks for creating the AI-guided writing project template within Cursor, tracking our development progress.

## Phase 1: Core Framework Components âœ“

### Completed:
- [x] Created `.cursor/rules/00_setup_guide.md` - The interactive setup file that will:
  - Guide users through project setup
  - Create appropriate folder structures
  - Generate author profiles
  - Create outlines based on chosen templates
  - Generate project plans
  - Create necessary rule files
  - Set up all directories (Manuscript/, Research/, Outlines/)

- [x] Created folder structure reference files:
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/heroes_journey_folders.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/three_act_folders.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/save_the_cat_folders.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/snowflake_folders.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/generic_novel_folders.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/nonfiction_folders.md`

- [x] Created necessary directories:
  - [x] `.cursor/rules/`
  - [x] `.cursor/Research/folder_structures/`
  - [x] `.cursor/Archive/`

- [x] Created document templates:
  - [x] `.cursor/templates/character_template.md`
  - [x] `.cursor/templates/setting_template.md`

  - [x] `docs/writing_templates/three_act_structure.md`
  - [x] `docs/writing_templates/save_the_cat.md`
  - [x] `docs/writing_templates/snowflake_method.md`

## Phase 2: Remaining Tasks

### Decision Tree for Setup Process
- [x] Create decision tree flowcharts to guide the setup process:
  - [x] Project type selection logic
  - [x] Structure recommendation logic based on genre/complexity
  - [x] Folder structure adaptation logic

## Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

- [x] Create documentation:
  - [x] User guide explaining the system
  - [x] Quick reference for common tasks
  - [x] Troubleshooting guide

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. Begin testing with various project scenarios
2. Finalize the project template for release
