# Author Project Template User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the AI-guided writing project template! This system is designed to help you organize, plan, and develop your writing project with the assistance of AI. Whether you're writing a novel, a non-fiction book, a short story collection, or managing multiple related projects like a book series or educational library, this template provides structure and guidance throughout your creative process.

## System Overview

This template consists of several integrated components:

1. **Folder Structure**: An organized file system tailored to your specific writing project and chosen narrative structure.
2. **Templates**: Pre-made document templates for characters, settings, scenes, and chapters.
3. **AI Guidance**: The AI assistant understands your project's structure and can help with planning, drafting, and revisions.
4. **Writing Frameworks**: Educational materials on different narrative structures (Hero's Journey, Three-Act Structure, etc.).
5. **Multi-Project Support**: Capability to manage multiple related projects within a single workspace.

## Getting Started

### Initial Setup

When you first open this project, the AI will guide you through an interactive setup process:

1. **Project Type Selection**: The AI will ask about your writing project type, genre, and goals.
2. **Project Organization**: You'll decide whether to set up a single project or a multi-project collection (like a book series or educational library).
3. **Structure Selection**: You'll learn about different writing structures and select one that fits your project.
4. **Folder Creation**: Based on your choices, the AI will create an appropriate folder structure.
5. **Author Profile**: The AI will help you define your writing style preferences.
6. **Initial Outline**: A basic outline will be created based on your chosen structure.
7. **Project Plan**: A customized project plan will be generated with appropriate phases and milestones.

### Directory Structure

After setup, your project will contain these main directories:

For single projects:
- **Manuscript/**: Contains the actual writing, organized by chapters, acts, or other structural elements.
- **Outlines/**: Holds the project outlines, from high-level to detailed scene breakdowns.
- **Research/**: Stores character profiles, setting descriptions, worldbuilding notes, and reference materials.
- **.cursor/**: Contains system files, templates, rules, and your author profile information.
- **docs/**: Houses documentation, guides, and educational materials.

For multi-project collections:
- **Projects/** or **Series/**: Contains individual project folders, each with their own manuscript, outline, and research materials.
- **Shared/**: Holds resources that span multiple projects (characters, settings, terminology, timelines, templates).
- **Meta/**: Contains collection-wide planning documents and master outlines.
- **.cursor/**: Contains system files, templates, rules, and your author profile information.
- **docs/**: Houses documentation, guides, and educational materials.

## Using the System

### Working with AI

The AI assistant is designed to help you throughout your writing process:

1. **Ask for guidance**: "How should I structure the next chapter?"
2. **Request content**: "Help me draft a scene where my protagonist faces their fear."
3. **Get feedback**: "Review this passage and suggest improvements."
4. **Maintain consistency**: The AI tracks details about characters, settings, and plot points.
5. **Cross-project support**: "How does this event in Book 1 affect the character's motivation in Book 3?"

### Templates

Access and use the pre-made templates for different elements of your project:

1. **Character Template**: `.cursor/templates/character_template.md`
2. **Setting Template**: `.cursor/templates/setting_template.md`
3. **Scene Template**: `.cursor/templates/scene_template.md`
4. **Chapter Template**: `.cursor/templates/chapter_template.md`

Ask the AI to create a new file using any of these templates when needed.

### Outlining and Planning

The system supports a recursive outlining process:

1. **High-Level Outline**: Begin with the main story beats or major sections.
2. **Detailed Outline**: Expand each beat into more detailed story points.
3. **Scene Planning**: Plan individual scenes with goals, conflicts, and outcomes.
4. **Revisions**: Update outlines as your project evolves.

For multi-project collections:
1. **Collection Outline**: Maintain a master outline showing relationships between projects.
2. **Project-Specific Outlines**: Create detailed outlines for each individual project.
3. **Cross-References**: Establish connections between related elements across projects.
4. **Timeline Management**: Track chronology across multiple works in a series.

### Maintaining the Project Plan

Your project plan (in `docs/plan.md`) serves as a roadmap:

1. **Track Progress**: Check off completed items as you work.
2. **Update Regularly**: Add new tasks or modify existing ones as needed.
3. **Set Milestones**: Use the plan to set achievement goals.

For multi-project collections, use the collection plan (`docs/collection_plan.md`) to:
1. **Coordinate Development**: Manage the timeline for developing multiple projects.
2. **Track Dependencies**: Identify when one project depends on elements from another.
3. **Balance Resources**: Allocate writing time and effort across different projects.

## Working with Multiple Projects

If you're managing a multi-project collection, the system provides several specialized features:

### Shared Resources

The `Shared/` directory contains elements used across multiple projects:

1. **Characters**: Maintain consistent character profiles for characters appearing in multiple works.
2. **Settings**: Keep descriptions of locations consistent across projects.
3. **Terminology**: Ensure technical terms, magic systems, or special concepts remain consistent.
4. **Timeline**: Track the chronological relationship between events across different works.
5. **Templates**: Use standardized templates to maintain visual and structural consistency.

### Cross-Project Navigation

Navigate between related projects by:

1. **Using the master outline**: The collection outline shows connections between projects.
2. **Following cross-references**: Links between related elements help maintain context.
3. **Checking the timeline**: See how events in different projects relate chronologically.

### Consistency Management

The AI helps maintain consistency across projects by:

1. **Tracking shared elements**: The AI monitors characters, settings, and terminology across projects.
2. **Flagging inconsistencies**: The AI identifies potential contradictions between projects.
3. **Suggesting connections**: The AI can recommend ways to strengthen connections between related works.

## Writing Frameworks

Educational materials for different narrative structures are available in the `docs/writing_templates/` directory:

- **Hero's Journey**: A 12-stage mythic structure for character transformation.
- **Three-Act Structure**: The classic beginning-middle-end structure.
- **Save the Cat**: A 15-beat screenplay structure adaptable for novels.
- **Snowflake Method**: Start with a premise and expand outward.

Each guide explains the structure's principles and how to apply them to your writing.

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain Your Outline**: Keep your outline updated as your story evolves.
2. **Use Templates**: Leverage the templates for consistency in your world-building.
3. **Regular Check-ins**: Periodically review your project plan to stay on track.
4. **Customize As Needed**: Adapt the system to fit your unique writing process.
5. **Backup Your Work**: Regularly back up your project to avoid data loss.
6. **For Multi-Project Collections**:
   - Update shared resources whenever elements change
   - Consult the collection-wide timeline when working on chronology-sensitive content
   - Use cross-references liberally to connect related elements
