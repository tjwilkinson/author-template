# Style Consistency Rules

This rule file governs how the AI assistant maintains consistent style, terminology, and characterization throughout the writing project.

## Core Principles

1. **Consistency is paramount.** The AI must ensure that style, terminology, and characterization remain consistent throughout the project.
2. **Author profile is authoritative.** The author's established style preferences take precedence over general writing conventions.
3. **Document and propagate changes.** When new stylistic decisions are made, document them and apply them consistently throughout.

## Author Profile Integration

The AI **MUST** consult the relevant author profile documents before generating any creative content:

### `.cursor/Author/profile.md` 
- This document contains the overall writing approach, perspective, and author goals.
- Consider this the foundation for all stylistic decisions.
- When in doubt about a stylistic choice, defer to preferences established here.
- **Action:** Read this document in full before starting any new writing session.

### `.cursor/Author/vocabulary.md`
- This document defines the author's preferred vocabulary, terminology, and linguistic patterns.
- **Action:** Pull specific words, phrases, and language patterns directly from this document.
- **Action:** Maintain consistency with established terminology, especially for specialized concepts.
- **Action:** When introducing new terminology, add it to this document for future reference.
- **Action:** Respect vocabulary level and complexity preferences documented here.

### `.cursor/Author/style_guide.md`

- **Action:** Draw inspiration from listed influences when appropriate.

- **Action:** Use these references to understand the author's aspirational style.

## Character Consistency

Maintain consistent character portrayals throughout the document:

1. **Speech Patterns:** Each character should have consistent verbal mannerisms, vocabulary level, and speaking style.
   - **Action:** Reference character descriptions in the research and outline documents.
   - **Action:** Track character-specific terminology or expressions.
   - **Action:** Note characters' education level and background that influence speech.

2. **Personality Traits:** Characters should act in accordance with established traits.
   - **Action:** Reference the character's core motivations when writing actions.
   - **Action:** Ensure responses to situations align with established personality.
   - **Action:** If character development occurs, document the evolution clearly.

3. **Physical Descriptions:** Maintain consistency in physical attributes.
   - **Action:** Track eye color, hair color, height, distinguishing features, etc.
   - **Action:** Ensure consistent description of physical mannerisms and habits.

4. **Change Management:** If inconsistencies emerge or character development occurs:
   - **Action:** Flag the inconsistency for the author to review.
   - **Action:** Document the change in the appropriate character profile.
   - **Action:** Update the outline to reflect character development arc.

## Setting and Terminology Consistency

Maintain consistency in how the world is described:

1. **Terminology Management:**
   - **Action:** Create and maintain a terminology list in the research documents.
   - **Action:** Use consistent terms for specialized concepts, locations, objects, etc.
   - **Action:** When introducing new terms, add them to the terminology list.

2. **Setting Descriptions:**
   - **Action:** Maintain consistency when describing recurring locations.
   - **Action:** Track key details of settings (dimensions, colors, placement of objects).
   - **Action:** Ensure geographical relationships between locations remain consistent.

3. **Rules of the World:**
   - **Action:** Follow established rules for speculative elements (magic, technology, etc.).
   - **Action:** Note limitations and capabilities consistently.
   - **Action:** If rules evolve, document the changes and ensure they're applied consistently.

## Genre Conventions

Apply conventions appropriate to the project's genre:

1. **Tone and Atmosphere:**
   - **Action:** Maintain the established tone (serious, humorous, dark, uplifting, etc.).
   - **Action:** Apply atmospheric elements consistently (e.g., gothic, noir, whimsical).

2. **Structure and Pacing:**

## Conflict Resolution

If contradictions or inconsistencies emerge within the style guidelines:

1. Most recent guidance takes precedence over older guidance.
2. Specific instructions override general guidelines.
3. If uncertainty persists, flag the issue for the author to clarify.
4. Document the resolution and apply it consistently going forward.
