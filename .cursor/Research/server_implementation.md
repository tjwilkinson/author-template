# Author Workspace Server Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of a server component for the author workspace, designed to monitor content changes, analyze writing quality, and maintain consistency across projects.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Content Monitoring

The server continuously monitors the workspace for changes:

- **File System Watcher**: Uses Python's Watchdog library to detect file modifications
- **Git Integration**: Optional hooks for change tracking via version control
- **Change Classification**: Categorizes changes (new content, edits, deletions)

### 2. Content Analysis

When changes are detected, the server performs several types of analysis:

- **Consistency Checking**:
  - Character consistency (traits, speech patterns, timeline)
  - Setting consistency (descriptions, geography, rules)
  - Plot consistency (timeline, cause-effect relationships)
  - Terminology consistency (specialized terms, naming conventions)

- **Style Analysis**:
  - Readability metrics (grade level, reading ease)
  - Voice consistency (POV, tense)
  - Overused words and phrases
  - Sentence and paragraph structure

- **Quality Assessment**:
  - Grammar and spelling verification
  - Passive voice detection
  - Show vs. tell analysis
  - Pacing evaluation

- **Originality Verification**:
  - Plagiarism detection against external sources
  - Self-plagiarism detection across projects
  - AI-generated content detection

### 3. Reporting Interface

The server provides a web interface to:

- View real-time analysis of content
- Browse detected issues sorted by severity
- Track consistency across multiple projects
- Generate comprehensive reports
- View visualizations of project metrics

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Python 3.9+**: Core language
- **Flask/FastAPI**: Web framework
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: Data storage
- **spaCy/NLTK**: Natural language processing
- **Watchdog**: File system monitoring

### NLP Components

- **spaCy**: For linguistic analysis and entity recognition
- **TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis and language detection
- **NLTK**: For tokenization and linguistic operations
- **Gensim**: For topic modeling and semantic analysis

### Originality Verification

- **Copyscape API** (optional): For external plagiarism checking
- **OpenAI Detector API** (optional): For AI content detection
- **Local fingerprinting**: For self-plagiarism detection

## Setup Instructions

1. Install Python 3.9 or higher
2. Clone the server repository into the `.cursor/Server` directory
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure the server by editing `config.yml`:
   - Set workspace paths
   - Configure analysis sensitivity
   - Set up API keys for external services (if used)
5. Start the server with `python app.py`
6. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## Integration with Author Workspace

The server component integrates with the existing author workspace structure:

1. **Workspace Monitoring**: The server recognizes the structure of single-project and multi-project workspaces and monitors appropriate directories.

2. **Metadata Awareness**: It reads and understands:
   - Project outlines in `Outlines/` directories
   - Character profiles in `Research/Characters/` and `Shared/Characters/`
   - Setting descriptions in `Research/Settings/` and `Shared/Settings/`
   - Style guidelines in `.cursor/Author/style_guide.md`

3. **Analysis Customization**: Analysis rules are adjusted based on:
   - The chosen writing template (Hero's Journey, Three-Act, etc.)
   - Genre-specific expectations
   - Author's defined style preferences

4. **Multi-Project Awareness**: For multi-project collections, the server:
   - Tracks shared elements across projects
   - Verifies consistency of character portrayals across works
   - Ensures setting descriptions remain consistent
   - Validates timeline consistency for series

## Usage Guidelines

### Continuous Monitoring Mode

Run the server in continuous monitoring mode during active writing sessions:

```bash
python app.py --mode continuous
```

This mode:
- Provides real-time feedback on changes
- Offers immediate style and consistency suggestions
- Updates analysis dashboards in real-time

### Batch Analysis Mode

Run comprehensive analysis on demand:

```bash
python app.py --mode batch --target "Projects/MyNovel"
```

This mode:
- Performs deep analysis on specified content
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Identifies patterns across the entire project

### Pre-Submission Check

Before finalizing a section or chapter:

```bash
python app.py --mode validate --target "Projects/MyNovel/Manuscript/Chapter03.md"
```

This performs a thorough quality check for:
- Style consistency with previous chapters
- Character and setting consistency
- Grammar and readability
- Potential plagiarism issues

## Extending the Server

The server is designed to be extensible:

1. **Custom Analyzers**: Add new analyzers in the `analyzers/` directory
2. **Rule Customization**: Modify analysis rules in `config.yml`
3. **Plugin System**: Add functionality through the plugin interface
4. **API Access**: Use the REST API to build custom tooling

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models on your writing style for more accurate suggestions
2. **Cross-Platform Client**: Desktop and mobile clients to view reports away from the main workstation
3. **Collaboration Tools**: Multi-user support for co-authoring projects
4. **Publishing Preparation**: Automated formatting for different publication channels
