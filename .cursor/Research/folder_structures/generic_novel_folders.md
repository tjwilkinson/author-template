## Adaptation Guidelines

This structure can be adapted based on:

1. **Writing Style:**
   - Discovery Writers: Focus on Character and Setting folders initially, develop Plot folder as you write
   - Plotters: Develop detailed outlines in Plot folder before beginning manuscript
   - Hybrid Approach: Develop Character and major Plot points, then alternate between planning and writing

2. **Genre Requirements:**
   - Fantasy/Sci-Fi: Expand Setting folder with more world-building elements
   - Mystery: Add clue-tracking and red herrings sections
   - Historical: Expand Research folder with period-specific information
   - Romance: Enhance character relationship sections
   - Thriller: Add tension and pacing tracking

3. **Project Complexity:**
   - Standalone Novel: Use as is
   - Series: Add series folder with series arc and continuity tracking
   - Complex Narrative: Add additional structure tracking for multiple POVs or timelines

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Adaptability:** Works with any writing approach or methodology
2. **Scalability:** Can grow or shrink based on project needs
3. **Progressive Development:** Supports iterative story development
4. **Multi-dimensional Planning:** Balances character, plot, and setting development
5. **Revision Support:** Separates drafts while maintaining access to planning materials

## Implementation Notes

- Create templates for common document types (character sheets, scene cards, etc.)
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout
- Consider using document links between related files (character to scene, etc.)
- Maintain regular backups of the entire structure
- Update the project plan with milestones and deadlines
- Use the journal to track writing progress and challenges
- Consider adding version numbers to significant document revisions
- Review and update outlines as the manuscript evolves
