# Hero's Journey Folder Structure

This reference guide provides a recommended folder structure for projects following the Hero's Journey narrative framework.

## Core Concept

The Hero's Journey is a 12-stage narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell and refined by Christopher Vogler. This folder structure organizes the manuscript and supporting materials to align with this framework, making it easier to track character development, thematic elements, and plot progression through each stage.

## Adaptation Guidelines

This structure can be adapted based on:

1. **Project Complexity:** 
   - For simpler projects, consider combining some stages within Act folders
   - For complex projects, you might add additional sub-folders within each stage

2. **Genre Specifics:**
   - Fantasy: Add worldbuilding folders under Research
   - Mystery: Add clues tracking folder under Research
   - Romance: Add relationship development tracking under Research

3. **Multi-POV Projects:**
   - Consider organizing by character journey instead of/in addition to stages
   - Track parallel journeys in the outline documents

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Plot Progression Tracking:** Clearly visualize progress through the journey stages
2. **Character Development Alignment:** See how character arcs align with journey stages
3. **Thematic Development:** Track thematic elements as they develop through stages
4. **Symbolic Tracking:** Follow symbols and motifs through their transformation
5. **Flexible Reorganization:** Easily move scenes between stages as needed

## Implementation Notes

- Name scene/chapter files with numbering (e.g., `01_Meeting_Mentor.md`) to maintain order
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout
- Consider color-coding or tagging by stage for visual organization
- The structure supports both outlining-first and discovery writing approaches
