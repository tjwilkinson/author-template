# Snowflake Method Novel Project Folder Structure

This reference guide provides a specialized folder structure optimized for novels using the Snowflake Method developed by Randy Ingermanson, which advocates for iterative expansion from a simple premise to a complex narrative.

## Core Concept

The Snowflake Method structure organizes your novel project according to the 10 steps of the technique, allowing you to progressively expand your story from a one-sentence concept to a complete manuscript through systematic iteration.

## Recommended Folder Structure

## Adaptation Guidelines

This structure can be adapted based on:

1. **Project Complexity:**
   - Simple Novel: Focus on just Steps 1-6 before drafting
   - Complex Novel: Expand Steps 5-8 with more detailed breakdowns
   - Series: Add a series folder with overall arc documentation

2. **Genre Requirements:**
   - Mystery: Add clue tracking in Step 8 and mystery elements folder
   - Fantasy: Expand Settings section with world-building elements
   - Historical Fiction: Expand Research section with historical details
   - Romance: Enhance character relationship sections

3. **Writing Style:**
   - For detailed outliners: Expand scene descriptions in Step 9
   - For discovery writers: Use Steps 1-5 as a framework, then combine Steps 6-10
   - For hybrid approaches: Adapt the level of detail in Steps 6-9

## Key Benefits of This Structure

1. **Progressive Development:** Clear path from simple idea to complete manuscript
2. **Character Integration:** Characters and plot develop in tandem through iterations
3. **Structural Integrity:** Each expansion builds on previous work without contradictions
4. **Flexible Planning:** Can be adapted for different levels of outlining preference
5. **Reduced Rewrites:** Structural problems identified before significant drafting begins

## Implementation Notes

- Complete each step before moving to the next for best results
- Use the step folders to store both your current version and previous iterations
- Consider using different colors or tags for each expansion stage
- Track changes between iterations to ensure consistency
- Create a "parking lot" document for ideas that don't fit the current iteration
- Review each step's output against previous steps to ensure consistency
- Use templates for character charts and scene descriptions to maintain consistency
- Consider using specialized snowflake method software alongside this folder structure
