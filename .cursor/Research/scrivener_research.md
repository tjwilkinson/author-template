# Scrivener Research Summary

*   **Purpose:** Scrivener is a dedicated writing application designed for managing long and complex writing projects. It's used by novelists, screenwriters, academics, journalists, and other writers dealing with extensive texts.
*   **Core Metaphor:** It uses a "ring-binder" or "scrapbook" metaphor, allowing writers to break down their work into smaller, manageable sections (like chapters or scenes) and easily rearrange them.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Non-Linear Structure:** You can write scenes or sections out of order and assemble them later.
    *   **Integrated Research:** Keep research materials (notes, images, PDFs, web pages) directly within the project file, alongside the manuscript.
    *   **Outline & Corkboard:** Provides tools for outlining, viewing synopses on a virtual corkboard, and restructuring the project.
    *   **Compilation:** Combines the various sections into a single document for export in standard formats (e.g., Word, PDF, ePub).
    *   **Writing Goals & Statistics:** Set targets (word count) and track progress.
    *   **Distraction-Free Mode:** A full-screen writing mode to minimize distractions.
    *   **Snapshots:** Save previous versions of text sections to revert changes easily.
    *   **Platform Availability:** Available for macOS, Windows, and iOS.
*   **Philosophy:** Scrivener aims to provide the tools needed to *start writing and keep writing*, without prescribing a specific writing method. It focuses on organization and managing the complexity of large projects from initial idea to final draft.
