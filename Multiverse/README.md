## Cross-Referencing System

All content uses a consistent cross-referencing system to link related materials across the different directories.

## File Naming Conventions

- Follow consistent naming conventions within each directory (e.g., BookTitle/, Chapter01.md; FrameworkName.md; CharacterName.md).

## Development Workflow

1. Develop foundational frameworks and document products in `AuthorResources/`.
2. Create reusable story elements (characters, settings) in `StoryElements/`.
3. Author content (books, stories, courses, etc.) in `Published/`, referencing materials from `AuthorResources/` and `StoryElements/` as needed.
4. Maintain cross-references between all content types.
