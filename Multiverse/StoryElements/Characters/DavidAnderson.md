## Background

David grew up in a middle-class family in Chicago. His father ran a small hardware store where David worked weekends and summers, learning the value of customer relationships from an early age. After getting a business degree from a state university, he started in entry-level sales at a tech company.

Unlike many in his field, David didn't have an immediate talent for sales. He struggled his first year, nearly getting fired before finding a mentor of his own who taught him the GUTS method. After applying these principles, his career took off. He climbed the ranks steadily, working at three different companies before landing at TechVision, where he's been for the last twelve years.

He's divorced with two college-aged children. The divorce was amicable, and he maintains good relationships with his ex-wife and kids. This personal setback taught him resilience and the importance of balance between work and personal lifeâ€”lessons he passes on to his mentees.

## Personality

- **Leadership Style:** Supportive and guiding rather than directing. Prefers asking questions that lead his mentees to discover answers themselves
- **Communication:** Direct but kind. Excellent listener. Uses stories and metaphors to illustrate points
- **Temperament:** Calm, patient, rarely loses his temper though can show carefully controlled disappointment
- **Humor:** Dry wit, often self-deprecating, uses humor to diffuse tension
- **Flaws:** Can sometimes be too forgiving of repeated mistakes. Occasional blind spot when it comes to adopting new technologies/methods
- **Values:** Integrity above all, genuine concern for customers, personal growth, work-life balance

## Habits and Mannerisms

- Leans forward when truly engaged in conversation
- Takes notes in a small leather-bound notebook he always carries
- Asks "What did we learn?" after any setback
- Occasionally quotes his own former mentor
- Steeples fingers when thinking deeply
- Makes coffee for the office team every morning, remembering everyone's preference

## Speech Patterns

- Tone: Measured, warm, authoritative without being dominating
- Pace: Speaks deliberately, comfortable with thoughtful pauses
- Vocabulary: Substantial but not showy, avoids jargon, uses simple analogies for complex concepts
- Catchphrases: "Let's unpack that," "The customer isn't buying a product; they're buying a future," "This is where the real work begins"

## Relationships

- **With Protagonist:** Sees potential others miss. Challenging but supportive. Gradually transitions from mentor to colleague as protagonist grows
- **With Antagonist:** Professional but wary. Has likely encountered similar types throughout his career
- **With Others:** Respected by colleagues. Has a network of industry relationships built on mutual respect rather than exploitation

## Arc and Development

David's personal journey involves learning to embrace change even as he teaches timeless principles. Throughout the story, he faces his own challenge of adapting to new market realities and technologies, showing that even mentors continue to grow.

## Defining Scenes

1. The initial meeting where he sees potential in the protagonist that others (including the protagonist) miss
2. A tough-love moment when the protagonist tries to take shortcuts
3. Revealing his own past failures to encourage the protagonist during a low point
4. Demonstrating the GUTS method in action with a particularly difficult client
5. A moment of vulnerability when he admits to struggling with some new aspect of the business

## GUTS Method Philosophy

David firmly believes in the GUTS method not just as a sales technique but as a philosophy of human interaction:
- Genuine interest in solving others' problems
- Understanding the real needs behind stated desires
- Truth in all communications, even when difficult
- Service mindset that prioritizes long-term relationships over short-term gains

## Notes for Writing David

- David should embody the GUTS method in all interactions, not just sales situations
- His lessons often apply to life beyond sales
- While wise, he should never seem infallible or unrealistically perfect
- His character demonstrates that emotionally intelligent approaches to business are ultimately more successful than manipulative ones

## TEST NOTE

This is a test line to check the server's analysis capabilities. As an AI language model, I have added this text to test plagiarism detection and AI content identification. We can use this to analyze how well the server tools work.

In conclusion, this section has been added to test the detection capabilities. It's important to note that AI-generated content often contains certain patterns and phrases like "as we can see" and "it should be noted" that can be detected by sophisticated algorithms. To summarize, this paragraph should trigger the AI content detection with its unnaturally consistent sentence structures, use of transitional phrases, and explicit mention of being AI-generated content. Moreover, it is essential to recognize that this paragraph serves a specific testing purpose within the overall document analysis workflow.
