This book is dedicated to a memory. It was the 1970’s and a couple of young, totally fearless fellows (we didn’t know better) used to drive a pickup truck (a beatup Ford F-100). It was never designed for the loads we hauled in order to sell  tools off the back of its bed, but we did it anyway! These New Jersey dudes had  more G.U.T.S. in sales than any people I ever knew or have known since. One was  the author and the other was my long time friend Phil Kahn (champion Parsippany  golfer) who used to ride with me all day on country roads from New Jersey to Virginia. We would knock on doors, walk into factories, companies and gas stations  and ask if anyone would like to buy a bunch of stuff for a good price off the back of  the truck. We were brave, unrelenting, totally nuts and we made money every day.  We also stopped in all kinds of weird places to chow down. Man we had fun and I  learned some of the best ideas ever developed about selling smart. Thank you,  Phil Kahn! Additional and special thanks to CJ for all of her patience and remarkable editing  skills that make my book readable!  Thanks also goes to Nolan Smith of Kremmling, Colorado who so gladly let me use  his excellent name when I needed one! And finally, thank you Bob Johnson, for his suggested acronym for G.U.T.S.™ Copyright © 2004-Revised and Updated 2006.

INTRODUCTION “When I was a kid, I remember people would tell me to SHUT UP! Now, they pay a lot of  money to listen to me! Go figure?” Claude   Sleazy, Liar, Big Mouth, Annoying, Nuisance, Loud, Obnoxious, Exaggerator are  all words describing salespeople, actually sounds like the beginning of the story of  Snow White and the Decrepit Dwarfs! Some other descriptive favorites are Manipulative, Cheap Polyester Suits and the Infamous, Willie Loman from Arthur  Miller’s Death of a Salesman. These are all terms that are conjured up when we  mention the words ‘sales, salesmen and salespeople’. Think about it, what proud  father or mother, in their right mind, would exclaim on the birth of their offspring:     “Here is my son/daughter, the future salesperson!” Yep, you’re right. It just ain’t going to happen. Having said all this I had many  sales jobs, from running the blue light special at K-Mart© to selling hot-dogs in the  South Bronx (da Bronx) for Swift Premium©. The training in sales ranged from nil  to sophisticated and included expensive seminars. I was good, but I was not making the money I envisioned and I grew to dislike the way many prospects were  treating me. They would keep me waiting in their offices while I was reading their  old boring trade magazines even though I had a firm appointment. Eventually, they  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

would grant me an audience. (Heck, the Pope would be easier to meet.) Sometimes  I would get an order, sometimes a BS session, other times disrespect, after all I was  only a salesman. I found myself making excuses not to go out and make presentations. I became a slacker because I just wasn’t feeling fulfilled. I mean how the  heck do you motivate yourself everyday when you get up in the morning? ‘Oh  boy’, he said to himself, ‘today I get to go out and have some prospective buyer  crap all over me again, what fun!’ In light of the above, I did meet salespeople who loved what they were doing, had  their own business and best of all, they were making unbelievable money while  having control and FUN with their lives. I was envious and I wanted what they  had; security, self-esteem and big bucks. Note: For those of you who disdain making money and just want to make the  world a better place, read no further! I had attended all of the modern sales seminars, read all of the classic books and  recent best sellers. What I found, for the most part, was that these guys were all  saying the same thing, but in different ways about presentations, closings and the  usual dog and pony shows blended with tons of hype and motivation. This stuff  was older than Methuselah (old guy in the Bible). I wanted to learn, but these  methods just didn’t seem to work for me on a long term basis. I thought that I  needed a Sales Mentor/Coach if I was ever going to get out of my sales rut, someThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 5

one who had achieved the success that I wanted and who had the right to teach me  because he was doing it correctly, all the way to the bank. I went out to find the best salesman in the world who would teach me his Method  of Success. Eventually my search was over because I found the person who gave  me the sales tools, the concepts and methods to make as much money as I wanted.  I called this the G.U.T.S. Sales Method© because it made me confident. It allowed me to work smart and have a blank check in front of me for the rest of my  life! This novel is based on that Mentoring relationship, the lessons learned and how my  life was never the same again. When I wrote my first book, The Mentor, A Story Of  Success©, I introduced gregarious Max, the Mentor in a readable, motivating and  hopefully memorable parable. Based on your favorable response (you have bought  a heck of a lot of my books, thank you) I have written The Mentor Teaches The  G.U.T.S. Selling Method© in the same style, hopefully with the same results.  Remember, Sales is the Million Dollar Skill!   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 6

What is the G.U.T.S.© Selling Method ? G=Great U=Unconventional T=Techniques of S=Selling I entitled my Selling Method by the most logical name of G.U.T.S. because that's  exactly what it takes to succeed in the world’s highest paying profession and man  is it worth it! Most people are trained to sell by giving long boring useless presentations, dog and  pony shows and silly, obvious and annoying closing techniques. When these methods don’t work and the prospect becomes reluctant and wishes to avoid the manipulation, the endless stalls and objections begin. The defense mechanism of the  buyer kicks in. The salesman, lacking courage, tries to close again and again until  the buyer either gives up from exhaustion, ends the conversation or feigns a new  rebuttal like the infamous “I have to think about it” or who can forget “I need to  discuss this matter with....” (usually a spouse or boss which is most likely a lie to  end this game).  What if the so called ‘professional’ salesperson had a Method where, if utilized  consistently, would enable his sales to increase dramatically, allow her to stay in  control, end the drudgery of sales and be a helluva lot more fun and profitable.  That is what the G.U.T.S. Method is all about.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 7

## Page 8

I always thought that it took G.U.T.S. to be a great salesperson, chutzpah or unmitigated gaul to make stuff happen. (Hey, I grew up in NYC :-). The Bible says  that “the meek will inherit the earth”, but in sales, the person who has the courage,  confidence, self-esteem and all these qualities together is a perfect description of  G.U.T.S. G.U.T.S., however, is not enough by itself. You need to work SMART  and use a Method that combines a step-by-step approach merging with the character qualities above. Having said all of this, there was a time in my life when I had  no G.U.T.S. or a Method. I was one of the ‘silent majority’ as President Nixon  called us. I went along with conventional wisdom, failed to stand out or express  my thoughts. I wanted to comply. Yes, I was one of the sheep and I was flat out  miserable!  What was funny was that I always loved sales. I loved the high when I could thoroughly convince the prospect to hand over a check or give me a purchase order. It  is still one of the greatest feelings in the world! The Method is about how to feel  good about yourself, staying in control and not tolerating others wasting your time,  knowledge and energy in the sales process. G.U.T.S. is all about working smart  within a Method, feeling good about yourself and making as much money as you  feel you are worth.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 8

Prologue It’s Monday morning and Leo is sitting in the last row of the sales meeting room  trying to stay awake for another very boring meeting held by the company's sales  manager. Leo feels that he is the world’s worst salesman and with good reason. He  is constantly rejected by his prospects or he gets the run around all the time. He is  treated with disrespect by his customers and his peers and frankly he is living from  paycheck to paycheck earning very few commissions. His credit cards are maxed  out and he is always behind in his bills. He is unmotivated and lacks any selfesteem. He hates getting up for work because he knows that each day gets worse.  Leo knows that there are a few fellow workers who love their jobs and are always  on the top of their sales, who make great money, drive nice cars and win all the  awards at the company annual conventions. Then one day something wonderful  happened and his life made a dramatic change for the better.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 10

The Monday Morning Sales Meeting Oh Gawd, Leo exclaimed, how the hell am I going to stay awake for another one  of these boring things? He decided that rather than fight the feeling of sleepiness,  he would give in, place his head on his arms and try to catch a few winks; after all,  he was in the back of the large meeting room and who would notice?  It’s 9:00 AM on Monday and as is the company's custom, the usual sales meeting is  called to order by 5 foot 2 inch Johnny T. Greed, the National Sales Manager for  Excelsior, Ltd. He is also known unofficially as the tormentor. Leo Silver, the  northeast territory salesman has been attending the same useless rah rah sessions  for 3 years and the meetings are always the same. Treat the top sellers like they  were royalty and then crap all over the rest of the sales staff.  Johnny marched into the room shaking hands like the President entering Congress  to give the State of the Union Address. He was dressed in his expensive custom  made Italian silk suit, Gucci shoes and wearing his Cartier watch. He began the  sales meeting with the usual perfunctory comments about changes in pricing and  shipping schedules. Then he began his same boring sales spiel. He always picked a  new subject to brief the “troops” as he liked to call the salespeople.  We have had some great individual record sales thanks to Nolan Smith, but we  missed the mark on our quota because a few people around here aren’t taking their  sales very seriously. How many of you have really gone out there and given presentations, met your quota and asked for the orders? He gave the room of salespeople  his typical sinister scan and then spotted a very tired Leo in the last row with his  head cradled in his arms.  Leo had dozed off during Johnny Greed’s monotonous monologue and started to  dream of the recent sales presentations he had given; all he could remember was  the embarrassment, rejection and fear he encountered when he went on sales calls.  He really hated the way some of the prospects treated him. He still shuddered when  he thought about his most recent sales call; one with the head buyer of the SussexThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 11

Morris Company particularly stood out in his mind. Leo had called the office of the  head buyer several times and finally finagled himself a meeting after several  months. He was on time for his appointment, but was kept waiting for 2 hours in a  small waiting room with very old magazines until he was summoned. Mr. Sloan will see you now Mr. Silver, the assistant had announced. Leo remembers  entering the cavernous office with the large golf bag leaning in the corner against  the wall. Behind the oversized desk sat Dick Sloan head buyer. Hey Silver, been  waiting long? You know how it is around here always busy-busy. So what are you  peddling? Leo was foolish enough to expect a decent apology because of the long wait, but  he never heard it from this rude dude. Leo began with the usual trivial comments  about the weather and then tried to engage the buyer about some local golf event  that made the news, but Sloan wouldn't hear about it. So tell me about your widgets and what they will cost us, he interrupted Leo. Leo began his sales presentation just as he was taught in the company's sales  school. He told the buyer all about how they used the finest materials to make their  widgets and how they had just won an award in Canada for manufacturing quality.  He brought out all kinds of slick color literature which he placed on Sloan’s desk.  He was no more than five minutes into the presentation when Sloan interrupted  him. Ok, Ok I’ve heard it all before. What's your best price for a gross? Leo told him that they cost $500 per widget. Sloan responded that $500 was too much, but he would think about it. Besides he  was only shopping around for widgets since he already had a supplier and he  wanted to know what the competition was offering. Hey, thanks Silver for dropping  by, he said as he stood up and shook Leo's hand indicating that the meeting was  over after only 9 minutes. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 12

## Page 13

Leo had been up half the night preparing for this presentation, but all he had to  show for all his efforts was an entry to write on his sales report. He felt used and  abused by this buyer and hoped it would be a long time before he returned. Sales  always made him feel like a second class citizen.  Leo recalled another recent painful sales call where the prospective buyer told him  that he would give him his highest consideration and that he should give him a call  on Monday basically to confirm the order. He left the office feeling that “he got  one”, but in reality it was just another lie. Leo remembers calling all day Monday,  then Tuesday and Wednesday. He left messages with the secretary, the voice mail,  he sent faxes, but no response. Finally the prospect took his call and told Leo that  he had given the order to a competitor. Leo was dying to ask him what he meant by  his "giving him the highest consideration comment" that he had made last week,  but he decided to just let it go. He sat thinking about the ‘sure thing’ sale he had last week. The client called Leo  to come on down to the office, that he was very interested in his product line and  couldn't wait to hear all about it. Leo made his appointment for the next day, put  on his best suit, collected all the necessary sales tools; brochures, slides and business cards. He arrived and was greeted like a long lost brother. He gave a million  dollar presentation. The buyer suggested lunch which Leo paid for, but really  couldn't afford so he charged it on his credit card which he knew was close to being maxed out. They returned to the office and Leo finally did what all salesmen  are taught to do, he asked for the order. The buyer, who had spent the last 4 hours with Leo looked him in the eye and exclaimed how much he loved the product line and told Leo that he was the best  salesman he had seen in a long time. He then said the words that really made Leo  cringe. Leo you know if it was up to me, we would buy your complete product line,  but money is tight right now and I won’t be authorized to make a purchase for at  least another 6 months or until the budget comes up for review. Leo was astounded at the gaul of the buyer who knew well in advance that he  wouldn't buy anything today or for that matter for months, but who made Leo give  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

him tons of product information and pricing, take him to lunch and waste half the  day. Leo was furious, but knew that he would not vent his anger because maybe  someday he would get a sale from this guy. He wished he could have told this guy  what a jerk he really thought he was.  Leo jumped from his seat when his fantasy was interrupted by the shrill voice of  Johnny T. Greed. Well I see our Mr. Silver is not finding our little meeting very interesting today. Johnny walked within a foot of Leo and in his most sarcastic voice  asked, Mr. Silver do you need some No-Doz© tablets in order to join the rest of us  in the land of the living? Leo reacted in a way that even surprised him. He looked at the tormentor and exclaimed, Hey Johnny, if you have some I sure could use ‘em, but I would rather  have a double espresso instead of this crappie cheap coffee you guys serve. Leo  relished the opportunity to reverse the tables, but he knew that playing games with  Johnny was basic hari-kari or suicide as the Japanese would say. One did not reply  in jest to Mr. Johnny T. Greed. Johnny's face turned cherry red as the entire room burst into uproarious laughter at  Leo’s remark. He never exhibited a sense of humor unless he was the one telling  the joke and it was usually at someone’s expense. He felt angered by Leo’s lack of  respect for him, a management superior. Well Johnny thought, I will show him.  It’s time to kick some butt, Leo Silver butt. Mr. Silver, let’s have a look at your  sales over the last quarter.  Oh, oh, Leo thought to himself, he was in for it now. Mr. Silver, I recall you had the lowest sales in the company the last time except for  Ms. Johnson who is out on maternity leave. Have you considered having a baby  Mr. Silver? Johnny questioned sarcastically. Have you reached your quota for the  last quarter?  No, Leo replied quickly in a quiet voice.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 14

## Page 15

Well then Sir, what gives you the right to take a nocturnal slumber during a sales  meeting where you might learn something? Why can’t you be more like Nolan  Smith? Now he is a “real” salesman Mr. Silver, unlike yourself.  Leo was ready to say something to Johnny and escalate the verbal battle, but another voice suddenly spoke up. Hey, Greed are you running a sales meeting here  or one of your peewee soccer camps. Let’s get down to business or I am leaving. I  have clients to see and real work to do.  Johnny turned around ready to do battle with another confrontational rebellious  salesman, but he recognized that this was no ordinary salesperson; this was Nolan  Smith. Nolan was standing in his usual perfectly custom tailored English Saville  Row business suit with matching Italian silk shirt and tie. Nolan waved Johnny to  return to the podium. In militaristic fashion, Johnny strode to the front of the room and resumed the  meeting. He didn’t want to start a fight with the company's number one top producer. When Nolan Smith spoke it commanded respect from everyone in the room.  He was in a league of his own. He was awarded so much stock in the company by  winning every sales contest that he had a seat on the Board of Directors. His counsel was always sought by the CEO, Mr. Ahrens. Johnny knew that Nolan was often offered key management positions, but steadfastly refused. He loved being a salesman too much. It was rumored that one day  he would force a takeover of Excelsior and run the company his way. He could  even be Johnny's boss someday. Leo was still fuming, but there was nothing he could do about the cutting remarks  made by Greed. The meeting was called to order and business resumed. A small  part of him even agreed with what Greed said; why couldn’t he be more like Nolan  Smith? Leo decided that he had to do something soon before it was too late; before  he lost all self respect. He had experienced the last humiliation he would ever tolerate from the likes of Greed.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 15

## Page 16

He had to find a way out of this quagmire of failure, but how? Money was tight, he  couldn’t quit because he needed every bit of his $32,400 base pay. He was in an  endless downward spiral of sales failure. He didn’t even have a personal life. It had  been months since he had the courage to ask any desirable girl out on a date. Saturday night was just another night in front of the TV; he needed a way out. He  needed help, but from where? When was he going to get a break in life? The meeting finally concluded and Leo waited until the room cleared out a bit so  he could leave without getting anymore unnecessary humiliating attention. Leo  quietly slipped into his small cubicle to read some of the latest sales literature on  widgets. A few minutes went by and someone tapped him on the shoulder, startling  him from his reading. It was Nolan Smith, the star salesman of Excelsior, Ltd. Hi there Leo, I was wondering if I might speak with you for a moment?  Leo nodded a surprised acknowledgment. Nolan had never spoken to him before  except for a quick ‘good morning’ when they passed each other in the hallway at  the company. I just wanted to let you know that I thought Greed’s behavior was way out of line.  He is a dinosaur and I have told him as much. He thinks that he can increase sales  in the company by intimidation, long senseless sales meetings, wasteful paperwork  and berating and humiliating the sales staff like he did to you today.  It’s no big deal, Nolan. I have heard it all before, besides I brought it on myself.  Greed was in no mood for my humor today. If I was a go-getter salesperson like  you, management types like Johnny would treat me a heck of a lot better.  That's just my point Leo, Nolan replied. You’re like a lot of the sales staff here; you  want to succeed, but no one has ever given you the proper tools, much less a  Method of Success. It’s like giving a commercial jet mechanic a kitchen spatula  and telling him to tune up the jet engines. Leo, you remind me of me when I first  started in sales.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 16

## Page 17

What do you mean Nolan? I am the the worst salesman in the company and you  are the best.  Listen my friend, things were not always the way you see them now. There was a  time, not that long ago when I was the one getting yelled at. My sales manager  from another company was yelling at me for my poor sales and attitude. I still remember the shame I felt when the whole sales staff was staring at me during a particularly cruel lecture from the sales manager. I was always broke, I had no selfesteem and sales were pure torture for me. When I heard Greed berate you today  during the meeting, it made my blood boil and it brought back a lot of unpleasant  memories of my own experiences. I made a spontaneous decision when I heard you give it to Mr. Greed during the  meeting. I LIKED THAT! You have spunk kid and more importantly, you haven’t  given up. I knew that you were the chosen one for me; the one I have been looking  for, the right Mentee. Leo, did you ever consider how your life could be different  with the right teacher? Leo was in a fog and wasn’t sure how to reply. What was Nolan talking about?  This stuff about Mentee, Mentor, commitment, teacher. Leo was confused and a bit  nervous by this display of interest and passion by the company's golden haired boy.  Leo replied, I never gave it much thought, Nolan. Nolan had his hand on his chin while rolling his eyes towards the ceiling in seemingly deep thought. Leo, I have a commitment that I made a long time ago. I made  a promise to my Mentor which I haven’t yet fulfilled and perhaps you can help me  or better said we can help each other. Leo, let’s get out of here, have some lunch  and I will explain everything.  Leo was wondering how he would pay for lunch, as he only had $5.00 in his wallet. Nolan, possibly sensing Leo’s anxiety added, lunch is on me, Protégé.  Why did you just call me Protégé, Nolan?  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 17

## Page 18

Be patient Leo, all of your questions will be answered in due time, but first let’s eat  and get better acquainted. I’m starving.  They went outside and made their way to Nolan's car, a new loaded Lexus. Leo sat  down in the rich soft leather seats. Leo sat admiring the array of toys, satellite radio  tuner, MP3 player, state of the art Bose stereo speakers and power buttons for all of  the gadgets. He melted into the heated/massaging power cushioned seats. All Leo  could think about was the old clunker he was using to get around in that broke  down each time he paid off the last repair. Noticing how his car was being admired Nolan commented, you like the car, Leo?  You bet Nolan, I always wanted to drive a show wagon like this.  Leo, what would you think if I told you that in 30 days you could be driving any car  your heart desires, you would be so confident about your income, so in control of  your life that anything was possible. Life could be a dream, my friend with the  right knowledge. Frankly Nolan, I find that very hard to believe.  Nolan took his eyes off the road for a second and gave Leo an intense look, just  you wait and see Protégé, he answered. Then he smiled coyly and pulled up in  front of DZ Akins, Nolan's favorite San Diego deli restaurant. The valet greeted  Nolan with a big, Hello Mr. Smith, good to see you again, Sir. Nolan was a regular  and his car was taken to a private VIP parking area. Upon entering the restaurant,  Leo spied a very long line of people he presumed were waiting for their tables. Above the loud decibel level of the restaurant and all the activity of waiters and  waitresses carrying multiple dishes of food on their arms an even louder bellow  was heard: NOLAN SMITH !!!!!!!!!! The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 18

## Page 19

A very large woman came up to Nolan, give him a bear hug and slathered lipstick  all over his cheek from her numerous kisses. Bubbala, she exclaimed, where have  you been lately? We’ve missed you! Why are you such a stranger? Hello Bertie, how are you? He asked, holding her hand.  Oh, you know, busy, busy. It’s so good to see you again. Bertie, I want you to meet a coworker and friend of mine, Leo Silver. Bertie is the  owner of DZs. Any friend of Nolan Smith is always a friend of mine and she gave Leo a more restrained hug. Nolan, we have your favorite table and Sarah will take you to it. Enjoy your food boys and try the seven layer cake, I just made it. They were taken inside by the hostess and were immediately escorted to a quiet  corner booth. Leo noticed pictures on the wall of all sorts of VIPs; politicians, famous actors and news anchors. On the table were giant tubs of pickles and green  tomatoes which Nolan proceeded to dive into. Try these Leo, they’re great and they  make them right on the premises.  The waiter gave them the largest laminated and most complex menu Leo had ever  seen and then poured 2 large glasses of freshly made iced tea. When the waiter returned for the order, Leo didn’t have a clue what to get.  Leo, if it’s all right, as you are my guest, let me order for you. Nolan looked up at  the waiter and requested ‘the usual please’.  Nolan began. Leo as you know, I am the top salesman in the entire company for  Excelsior and that includes our international and national sales divisions. I make  more money than any of them. I could tell Excelsior and Johnny to shove it any  time I wanted because I am a free man. They need me more than I will ever need  them. What you may not know is that less than 6 years ago, I was the worst salesThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 19

## Page 20

man in the world; I couldn’t even give away twenty dollar bills on the street corner.  Leo interrupted, I find that hard to believe Nolan.  Well, it’s true my friend, Nolan countered.  I learned from my Mentor that Sales is NOT about giving away information, making showy presentations, memorizing sales scripts and presenting fancy charts.  Sales is about WORKING SMART, HAVING FUN and ACHIEVING FINANCIAL  FREEDOM which can all be done with the G.U.T.S.© Sales Method.  Leo, I used to hate sales because I had no control over the sales process. I had a  low self image due to that lack of control and the abuse that was heaped upon me  daily. The worst of all was that I wasn’t making MONEY. The waiter interrupted  their conversation by bringing two enormous plates with the largest sandwiches  Leo had ever seen. I hope you like my favorite sandwich Leo, it’s corned beef, pastrami, tongue and chopped chicken liver on fresh rye bread. It’s not exactly health  food, but I find an occasional indulgence on special occasions is just fine. It looks good Nolan, Leo said as he picked up half the sandwich and realized how  hungry he was. Infact, it was delicious, but most of the meat fell out of the bread  and onto the plate. Nolan laughed out loud. The same thing happened to me when  my Mentor brought me here. Eating it takes a little practice, but it’s well worth it.  Nolan, tell me the truth. Why are you here with me? What is going on? Who is this  Mentor you keep talking about? Great questions Leo and as a matter of fact, asking questions is part of the Method  rather than giving away free product ideas and prices all day like most sales folk.  When we finish our lunch, I want to take you to meet a good friend of mine. He is  the man who changed my life and gave me the knowledge to enable me to have the  success, unlimited wealth and the freedom I always wanted.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

The Commitment  Delicious freshly brewed coffee and a hugh slice of seven layer chocolate cake arrived for Leo and Nolan. The waiter discreetly left the check with Nolan who immediately handed over his special, limited edition black American Express credit  card. Leo, let’s get down to brass tacks if you don’t mind and let me ask you a question  right up front. If we give you the Secrets of Success in Sales, all the necessary  steps you need to be able to make all the money you ever wanted or needed in life,  would you agree to make a commitment? Leo looked questioningly at Nolan and asked, what is this commitment? Well, Leo answered, it is a vow of sorts that was created by the Society of Mentors.  It’s an ancient and secret organization of select individuals who hand down information from one generation to another. They have been around for a long time and  value their privacy. Let’s leave this restaurant, take a walk and I will tell you more. They left through an enormous crowd of patrons waiting in line for their tables.  Nolan suggested that they take a short walk through the adjacent Japanese garden.  They entered the botanical display with its floral beauty and waterfall. It was a  peaceful surrounding, designed for solitude, contemplation and spirituality. It was  here that Nolan began to speak. Leo, if you want to make a difference in your life, a  change for the better then we need to proceed with the commitment first. Are you  ready?  Not understanding what Nolan was talking about, Leo responded, I’m not exactly  sure what I am getting into, but I do know that if I am not willing to change, then  my life will never be different. Let’s go for it. I’m ready. Leo, I need you to raise your right hand and repeat this solemn oath after me. “I  will never reveal this organization of Mentors to the masses or the media. I will  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 22

## Page 23

never misuse the knowledge I am about to learn, to harm or hurt another. I will  always maintain myself as a person of unquestionable character and integrity. I will agree to Mentor a worthy individual someday”. Leo Silver, do you vow to  abide by this commitment and all its passages? I do, Nolan, Leo dutifully responded.  Congratulations, Leo. Today’s your lucky day as you’re going to meet the Mentor.  But I thought that you were going to be my Mentor, Nolan. Since we know each other, I will be working with you as an adjunct Mentor, however, I want you to meet and spend some time with a truly unique man who is my  Mentor and he will be yours, too. What's his name? His name is Max and I have requested that he spend some time with you. I have  made arrangements for us to meet Max at his home in Colorado. Colorado! Leo exclaimed. I thought you said he lives on Long Island in New York.  Max chooses to live in many places. One of his favorite places is a huge log cabin  retreat high up in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. How the heck are we going to get there today, fly? You got it Leo. We are meeting Max’s private jet in 1 hour so we had better get  moving!  This is all going a little too fast for me Nolan, I don’t even have any clothes  packed. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 23

## Page 24

Not to worry my friend, all arrangements have been made. You will find fresh  clothes on the plane and all the necessary wardrobe and personal needs when we  arrive. Look alive my friend, you’re going to fly to Kremmling National Airport in  Kremmling, Colorado, population 1100, not counting cattle and sheep. They got into Nolan’s luxury car and made their way to Montgomery Field, a private airport in San Diego where they were escorted to a private jet. After a cursory  greeting from the captain and instructions on safety procedures from the flight attendant they relaxed in the luxurious cabin which came complete with a full  kitchen, bar, private office and bedroom. The twin turbine jet engines began their  whining sound and the plane taxied down the runway. Before Leo knew it, they  were cruising at 22,000 feet.  Leo, I suggest that you get some sleep before we land, as tomorrow is going to be  a full day, to say the least.  They were served some light refreshments and Leo began to doze off in the extra  large reclining leather seats. As sleep engulfed him, he wondered what lay in store  for him. What would Max, the Mentor be like? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 24

Meeting Max the Mentor They arrived in Colorado in the early evening to a brilliant sunset or ‘alpen glow’  as the locals call it. It’s a solar phenomenon that occurs when the sun’s rays hit the  snow capped mountain peaks in just the right way creating a bright orangy-pink  glow for a brief time. Leo and Nolan departed the plane as a large four wheel drive  Eddie Bauer Expedition pulled up to take them to their destination. They were  greeted by someone who seemed to know Nolan very well and who gave him the  car keys. It appeared as though everything had been prearranged. Nolan got behind the wheel while Leo sat on the passenger side and they began  their journey down a dark country road. Leo couldn’t help but notice that his ears  were popping as they climbed higher and higher. Soon snow began to appear on  the side of the road and eventually the road was completely covered in white. Nolan deftly maneuvered the behemoth SUV around hairpin turns as they continued  to climb. Fifty-five minutes later they turned off the road and pulled into a long  tree lined driveway with beautiful decorative lighting which gave a special glow as  the snow fell.  The entrance finally ended into a giant horseshoe in front of an enormous 3 level  custom designed log home. It was the largest home Leo had ever seen. It had gigantic glass windows with a wraparound deck. The base of the log home contained  smooth polished river stones to give it an earthy effect. Around the home were  copper and bronze statues of wildlife native to Colorado. Two huge wooden doors  with stained glass embedded into the panels stood in wait as Nolan knocked. An  older man with bright silver hair and a curious glint in his eyes greeted them. He  was wearing silk pajamas partly covered by a silk bathrobe which had a giant  monogramed “M” on the right shoulder. Welcome, boys, welcome! It’s late and I  was beginning to worry a bit what with the snow and all. Nolan, how are you? Fine, Max, fine, he replied clasping the older man’s hand in a hearty handshake.  This, as you know, is my new friend Leo Silver. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 25

## Page 26

Leo, this is my friend Max, who I have the honor of calling my Mentor. He... he... hello, Mr. Max, Leo stuttered. Hello young man, I have heard a great deal about you. Gentlemen, come on in to  my humble abode and make yourself at home, mi casa es su casa. They entered a cavernous wooden great room covered by old western pictures,  Remington statues and southwestern motif. There was a gigantic brick fireplace  that gave off wonderful heat. Old Mexican blankets with a multitude of bright colors hung from the ceilings. They followed the old man to the kitchen. You gentleman must be famished after  such a long flight. I am sorry cook has the night off, but I had a small meal made in  preparation of your arrival.   The kitchen was huge and included a stainless steel refrigerator and stove. In the  center was a beautiful laminated wooden table. On it was a variety of wonderful  Mexican foods that Leo recognized from his trip to Mexico years ago, succulent  foods like enchiladas, chile relleños, rice, guacamole, beans and warm tortillas.  Leo started to salivate when he realized how hungry he was despite the monster  sandwich he had had for lunch. Have some nachos and the fresh made guacamole  boys and be sure to wash it down with these wonderful fresh lime margaritas. They  are made with my favorite pure blue agave tequila “Patron”.  Leo sat quietly as he ate and listened to the conversation between Nolan and the  mysterious man Nolan called, with affection, ‘Mentor’. The food was delicious and hot and the margaritas were the best Leo had ever  tasted. After all the appetites were satisfied, Max suggested that they get a good  night’s sleep because tomorrow was going to be a serious workday. They were escorted by a young woman who worked for Max to their richly appointed bedrooms  which were decorated in the same southwestern style. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 26

Leo showered in the modern spotless bathroom. On the bed were some of the same  silk pajamas that Max was wearing except these were embroidered with the name  “Leo” on them. He put on the soft Japanese garments and found himself peacefully asleep seconds after his head hit the pillow.              The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 27

Working Smart Leo awoke early the next morning, totally refreshed, to the wonderful smell of bacon and eggs frying, bread baking and freshly brewed coffee wafting into his room. Being the clean type, Leo showered again and returned to see that new clothes  were neatly laid out for him on the bed. Of course, they weren’t just any old  clothes, these were top of the line name brands that Leo could only admire in the  windows of those expensive clothing stores. He wondered how they even knew his  underwear size. Oh well, he muttered to himself, one step at a time. He still really didn’t know what lay in store for him on this new day high in the  Colorado mountains. He had a slight altitude headache since he was over 10,000  feet up. He found a small bottle of aspirin and some Evian bottled water in the  small fridge by the TV in his room. Leo walked down the hand carved wooden staircase and was greeted in the breakfast nook off the kitchen by a sitting Nolan and Max who gave the appearance that  they had been up for several hours already. He made a mental note to get up earlier  the next morning and to copy the habits of these successful men. He walked over to the buffet table where another feast greeted him. This one was  managed by the kitchen staff, a senior man and woman who gave the appearance  that they were married. He grabbed a plate and loaded it with scrambled eggs, bacon, spicy seasoned home fries and a large serving of fresh strawberries. He sat  down with Nolan and Max and was immediately served a cup of rich hot coffee.  He wolfed down the tasty and filling breakfast and then Max began to speak. Well  my boy, ready to get down to business? Leo, I hear that sales has been a little disappointing for you.  That’s an understatement Mr. Max, Leo responded. Sales, for me is just another  word for misery. I find myself dealing with emotions like fear and rejection all the  time. I feel like someone who is either begging for an order or I act totally submissive and allow others to treat me with disrespect. Most days I feel like a broken reThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

cord giving a repetitious presentation until I am emotionally drained at the end of  the day. There are even days when the telephone is like a cactus and I can’t pick it  up or make a call to a prospect. The worst part is the money or better said, lack of it. Max, I want better things in  my life. I want to help other people, but I even have trouble paying my own rent  on time. I am always worried about my finances. I can’t even understand why I  am still in sales. Some guys like Nolan are natural born salesman, but I am not one  of them. Max smiled to himself while placing his hand on his chin and then he began to  speak. Leo, suppose I were to tell you that 6 years ago there was another young  man I met who was in exactly the same predicament as you, except much worse.  Yes, this particular Mentee thought Sales was a numbers game, an adventure of  chance. He figured that if he gave enough flamboyant presentations, eventually  someone might say ‘yes’ and actually buy something.  When the sales didn’t happen as expected and the rejection became too painful and  personal he did less and less work; as a result his sales became fewer and fewer.  Then the excuses began. He always figured it was someone else’s fault; the sales  manager, the product line, the pricing or the customers. You name it Leo and this  fellow had an excuse for everything. He assumed that a change in employment was  the answer so he would change employers ever year or so. You know, the old grass  is greener effect. He was quite the challenge for this old Mentor. So what happened to him, Max? Leo’s curiosity was really piqued. Well, once he learned the same G.U.T.S. Method that my Mentor taught me many  years ago, practiced it and put it into continual use, he discovered a whole new  world. Sales could now be fun, totally within his control and unbelievably profitable. He was a changed man and looked forward to going to work everyday. He  especially enjoyed the satisfaction and self-esteem that it gave him. He became the  top salesman in his company and genuinely prospered both financially and personThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 29

ally in ways he never thought were possible. Life was good and he learned to enjoy  and appreciate every day. Who is this Mentee, Max? Leo queried. I believe you know him, Leo. He is sitting next to you, Max smiled. Leo looked to his right even though he knew Nolan was sitting next to him and responded immediately. I find all of this hard to believe, Max. Nolan is the best darn  salesman in the company. He acts as though he was always this way. I figured him  to be a natural born salesman! Nolan began to laugh heartily. It took him a few moments to regain his composure  as he wiped a tear from his eye. Excuse me for interrupting Max, but let me have a  word. Believe it, Leo because it’s all true. If it wasn’t for Max and what he taught me I  would be sleeping in the back of the room with you during the sales meetings! The  worst part about my situation was that I, too was broke all the time and had little  self-esteem. When I began with Excelsior I decided to stop the chain of failure and  finally buckle down. I studied their sales materials and attended some of the conventional seminars that the company sent us on. It was the same old uninspiring  stuff. Find a prospect, give a long winded presentation, ask for the order, overcome  stalls and objections, ask for the order, then ask again and again. The prospect  would usually dismiss me, tell me that he would think about it, ask for more literature or a proposal or tell me to call back later. Every once in a while I’d get an order, but it usually felt more like luck than skill. I was playing the old ‘numbers  game’ method of sales. I remember a particular sales call where I had made an appointment with the  buyer. I had to drive 3 hours in traffic to get to his office and when I arrived I gave  him the world’s greatest presentation on Excelsior’s Widget line that you ever  heard. After 90 minutes the buyer told me that he loved the product line and if his  company wasn’t so strapped for money he would love to give me an order right  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 30

## Page 31

then. He stood up, shook my hand and dismissed me! I wasted another day of my  life as a salesman. The worst part was that it took 5 hours to get back to the office.  There was one benefit! While I was driving I did some heavy thinking. Leo, this  was the longest, hardest, cruelest drive of my life, but then something happened. I  started to think about how I had just wasted an entire day, had given away tons of  product and price information and had nothing to show for it. I was a pro bono  consultant. I knew that something had to change and fast or I was doomed to being  a failure. I was supposed to give a predetermined number of presentations per day and it  didn’t really matter how much time I wasted. I didn’t feel useful, but more like a robot giving the same canned speech to anyone who would listen. It was a senseless  numbers game that anyone could do, but few can put up with on a long term basis.  I knew that there was an answer out there, a solution and then it came to me. I  needed a Mentor. Someone who has a better way of doing things, someone who  had a Sales Success Method. It was then that I found my Mentor, I found Max or  rather Max found me through my friend Ralph*.  Ralph introduced me to Max and I made the commitment the same as you did, Leo.  I learned that sales could utilize a better understanding of human behavior and  reaction. I could now make as many sales and as much money as I wanted to. Max  made me treat sales like a profession and gave me the skills to do it with. Leo, did you ever ask yourself why my sales are always the highest in the company? Why I make more money than Johnny or for that matter, most of the company’s useless executives? * Read The Mentor, A Story of Success Well, Leo replied, I just figured that you were working harder than the rest of us or  were some kinda natural born super salesman. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 31

## Page 32

Wrong! I work less hours than the average salesperson at the company. The only  difference between me and the rest of the sales force is that I work smarter! I use  Max’s Sales Method, a G.U.T.S.© Sales Method! What do you mean by this sales Method you and Max keep talking about, Nolan? Well, let’s just think this through and discuss a couple of examples and maybe then  you will get the idea of why we place such an emphasis on a Method. Let’s take the McDonald’s hamburger franchise. The genius of Ray Kroc was that  he recognized a duplicatable Method of Success. He sold milkshake machines and  then one monumental day when he visited the McDonald brothers restaurant in  California he saw a ‘work smarter’ method. He witnessed lines of people waiting  for a simple hamburger, french fries and a shake. The entire order, cooking and  distribution process was systematized resulting in a quality product that could be  made consistently at a competitive price and served to customers in seconds. He  knew that if that Method could be duplicated he could expect the same results over  and over again.  Here’s another example of a work smart method. I am sure you are familiar with  Henry Ford and his innovative ideas and implementation of the assembly line  right? Sure Nolan, who hasn’t? Think about it Leo, cars were first built one at a time and it took a team of 12 men  over 24 hours to build just one car. Ford modified the assembly line where every  worker was designated a specific function. Once the assembly line was utilized the  time of assembling an auto was substantially reduced. The assembly line was a  structured method that reduced production time, increased quality and consistency  and gave a tremendous increase in profits. All that from one Success Method.  A Method is just an organized way of doing something repetitively with substantial,  obvious and predicable benefits and results. Why not apply a method to sales if the  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 32

## Page 33

results allow for consistent closings, quick qualifications and unbelievable profits?  Just imagine, Leo that you had an A-B-C type sales method so that you knew what  you had to do in every sales call. You would not move from A until you completed B  and then on to C. This Method would allow you to qualify the prospect in order to  make sure that you had a reasonable potential to close a sale step-by-step rather  than just winging it and wasting time. If you can’t get from A to B, then it’s over  and it makes no sense to move to C. It’s all about understanding the value of time,  knowledge, energy and working smart. Max taught me this remarkable method of  sales and my life has never been the same. Today I have control of my career, my  income and my life thanks to Max. Leo stood up from the table. So what is this Method you and Max keep talking  about? Max raised his hand to silence both of his protégés and then spoke. Nolan, why  don’t you take care of that special project we discussed earlier and we can meet  later for cocktails.  Got it boss, Nolan dutifully replied.  Max turned to Leo, let’s begin and learn the G.U.T.S.© Selling Method. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 33

## Page 34

The G.U.T.S. Philosophy Look Leo, before we get into the specifics or tools of the G.U.T.S. System I wanted  to discuss the philosophy behind the idea of smart selling. G.U.T.S. is more than a  technique for increasing sales, it’s also a philosophy, an attitude, a way of life. Wow, Max, this sounds like it’s going to get deep! You can’t even begin to imagine my boy. This stuff will rock your world. You have  to understand that selling is not for everyone, only for the relatively few who combine the science and understanding of human behavior and who have the skill of a  thespian. When combined, the results are astounding. I want you to reinvent yourself when you are selling. You are no longer just Leo, but you are a very skilled and  an in demand specialist whose time, knowledge and energy is sought by many because it is considered to be of high value. The initial premise of the G.U.T.S. philosophy is to be the best by acting as though you already are. But Max, how can I pretend I am a heavy hitter when I don’t have two nickels to  rub together? You are going to the esteemed University of Fake it ‘Til you Make it! Max smiled. You are going to take on the attitude of a winner; you will become one of the best  salespeople in the world. You will become one of the top wage earners in your  sales profession by acting that way. You see Leo, people love to work with a winner  and don’t really tolerate or respect a loser. In studies by The Ancient Mentors, it was discovered that sales is a combination of  specific scientific skills as well as an attitude or aura of success, that of very high  self-esteem and confidence. Now this may not be in your nature right now, but that  will change if you want to see different results. I am going to ask you to change  many things about the way you feel about yourself, the way you sell and it may not  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 34

## Page 35

be easy. My methods will probably make you very uncomfortable at first. Are you  alright with that? Sure Max, I can handle it, but tell me more about the G.U.T.S. philosophy stuff. Leo, successful sales is about having the G.U.T.S., the moxie, the sheer unmitigated  gaul or as my New York friends say ‘chutzpah’ to ask the questions that others are  too timid to consider. The meek may inherit the earth, but they will never become a  master G.U.T.S. salesman. In order to be able to accomplish the things you want,  you have to lose the typical subservient salesman attitude.  Excuse me for interrupting Max, but are you talking about me? No offense meant Leo, but yes I am!  That kinda hurts Mentor, but I guess there is some truth to it. There have been  times when I should have spoken up when the prospect treated me with less than  reasonable courtesy. If the customer perceives you as someone who doesn’t respect himself, why should  they treat you any differently? Would they treat someone they respected, such as a  doctor, when they were ill or an attorney who was representing them with the same  regard as a widget salesman? Ask yourself honestly Leo, was there ever an occasion or time when a prospect missed an appointment, kept you waiting too long or  treated you in a way that was less than respectful? Too many times Max, but what other recourse is there? Leo, you have to stop acting as though you are a little boy asking Mommy if it’s Ok  to take a cookie from the jar. You must realize that all your problems with your  prospects are your fault!  Why my fault, Max? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 35

## Page 36

It’s your fault because you tolerate it and the prospect knows it. The prospect will  treat you with the same regard that you have for yourself. If they sense that you  are weak, complacent or a beggar then they will take full advantage of it. A  G.U.T.S. salesman is special and has no time for a prospect unless they have a mutual respect. Act as though you have just won the top cash award in the lottery;  honestly Leo, would you let them continue to dump on you? Heck no Max, when you have money you don’t have to act so desperate all the  time. What about all this rapport, bonding, relational and consultative selling that  I keep hearing about, Max?  If you need a friend, then get a dog, Leo! Sales is about you, your success and  prosperity. It’s about you feeling so good about yourself and your product or service that everything else falls into place. I want you to embrace my special “LSDS”  rule. What do those initials stand for Max? “Leo’s stuff doesn’t stink”! I don’t want you to become egalitarian, officious or full  of yourself, but I do want to see an attitude, a 7 figure attitude. I know all the books  and seminars espouse the win-win thinking that the customer is always right. I  want you to win first and all the rest will fall into place. This may sound a little  self-centered, but when Leo Silver is on the phone or has a face-to-face meeting I  want the prospect to feel like they have an audience with someone of importance  and substance.  You have to become a specialist, a professional. You are a problem solver and as a  professional you have to understand your place in the sales process. You will undertake the attitude of a skilled doctor or attorney. You are dealing with patients or  clients who need what you can provide. You will determine this by your examination, diagnosis, discovery or whatever you want to call your line of questioning.  G.U.T.S. is about making money and feeling great about yourself all the time. This  results in truly being free, having a blank check that can bounce the bank. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 36

## Page 37

Most salesman do not realize that the only thing they have working for them is  what they know. So what do they do with their hard earned knowledge and experience? They give it away without any consideration or compensation and immediately diminish its value and even worse, lose all respect in the eyes of the prospect.  Wait a second Max, you make it sound like I shouldn’t share any information about  my product or service to the prospect. Correct, don’t give away anything until you find out if he or she can pay for it. The  old fashioned way of sales, which is still practiced by the majority of sales persons  is to view the prospect as an adversary, someone to conquer, to be tricked, someone who needs to be convinced, overwhelmed with facts and information. The  salesman has been taught to give presentations and hopes to make such an impression with his knowledge base, that he will make a sale.  He will get in front of a prospect, dispense information, talk in an obvious sales  type language in an attempt to overcome objections, stalls and repeatedly ask for  the order. In some cases, he will use closing and manipulative techniques that are  obvious which the prospect has heard before and resents. Techniques like “we only  have a few left, better act quickly” or “I’ve been authorized to make you this half  price offer if you act now”. These are transparent, old fashioned and cheesy sales  moves. By acting this way, the salesman becomes subservient to the prospect rather  than an equal or superior. He is the beggar rather than the professional that he  wants to be. He has no control of the sales process and is relegated to being a professional gambler, a crapshooter who has no idea whether or not he will prosper.  He has diminished himself as less than an equal. The prospect, realizing that most salespeople operate under the preprogrammed  old fashioned sales system, take advantage of this known behavior to his benefit.  They get free information, prices, proposals, literature, even hands on assistance in  their business without any commitment given. The salesman usually gives everything that is asked without receiving anything in return. Salespeople need to be  trained to have high self-esteem, The G.U.T.S. to ask the key questions first, before  they give any answers. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 37

## Page 38

The prospect lies, manipulates and evades any commitment. In many cases, they  treat the salesperson with disdain and very little, if any, respect and the salesman  accepts that as the price of his so called ‘profession’. This is just the way things  are, but not the way they have to be. Eventually the salesman becomes a real life  Willy Loman from Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. He blames everyone; the  prospect, his company, the economy, the government. Yes, he blames everyone except himself, the real culprit for his lack of success and humiliation. He becomes  despondent from the continual rejection and lack of prosperity. Is it any wonder  Leo, that the turnover rate for salespeople is the highest of any profession? Who  wants to go out into the world and be rejected all the time, day after day? Sales has  to be more than a simple numbers game, it has to be developed to embrace skills  and a specific G.U.T.S. philosophy. Jeez, Max when you put it that way, it’s no wonder I feel the way I do sometimes. You see Leo, there has to be a complete paradigm shift. There has to be a behavior  change if the modern salesperson is going to work smart and profit. Questions are  the answer, not the jabbering, senseless presentations or infinite unproductive door  knocking. This is the G.U.T.S. Philosophy, Leo! It’s not about the prospect, but  about you.  Life is just too short to drink cheap wine and drive a Yugo, my boy!   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 38

## Page 39

The G.U.T.S. Questions  The art and science of asking the correct Questions with Finesse. Imagine what it would be like if you got all of the nonqualified prospects out of the  way in just a few minutes with expert finesse questioning. Common sense tells you  that now you will have more time for the higher priority prospects; those who you  can close. You will spend your time, knowledge and energy on the people who are  worthy of it. You will be working smarter and making the big bucks. I want you to  learn how to work smart and not be afraid to eliminate a prospect that does not  meet the profile you are looking for.  Remember, we are here to listen well and glean enough information through questioning in order to make a determination if we can do business. We are not out to  socialize, bond, develop a rapport, make friends or act like we’re running a free  library or information resource.  Unlike other sales techniques, we don’t believe that sales is initially about relationships as much as it is about getting to the bottom line quickly. Leo, questioning is the means to get to your success; they are the key to working  smart, profitably and having tons of fun with sales. Let’s discuss how questions are  the force to propel you up the staircase of sales success. Let’s break it down into 3  different parts: the Why, When and What. Think about it for a moment.  Why do we ask questions? When should we ask questions? What type or kind of questions should we ask? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 39

## Page 40

Leo, have you ever heard of Socrates, the great philosopher? Sure Max! Essentially, Socrates felt that the best way to teach was not by telling or giving  endless presentations and lectures, but rather by questioning his students and allowing them the pleasure of deriving their own answers and conclusions by thinking logically. The G.U.T.S.© Sales Method uses a similar method for allowing the  salesman to control the sale covertly, obtain the necessary and pertinent information in order to work smart and profit more often. Leo, I want you to become Socratic in your approach and ask questions of your prospects; smart, provoking and  discovery questions. Let the prospect get involved in the sales process and do some  of the work by answering your selective interrogatories. How many times Leo, has  the prospect asked you question after question, you worked your butt off giving all  the answers only to result in no commitment, a delay, an objection and no sale? Way too many times Max, Leo answered very quickly. Dispensing free information like a library is not profitable in business. Your job in  sales is to be in control, profit and have fun with the process. If you understand  how the prospect reacts and behaves to specific questions then you are the one who  can lead them in the correct direction without exhausting yourself. You can do all  this and much more if you are willing to learn as Socrates did, that all the answers  are in the questions and the way in which you ask them. Let’s move on Leo, we have much to cover. Have you ever wondered:  Why do we ask questions? Sure Max, because we need to qualify the prospect; we need information. I usually  try to ask a couple of questions during a presentation. This is a basic principle  taught in Salesman 101. What is different about your method? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 40

## Page 41

The basis of G.U.T.S. is to derive enough information to qualify your prospect and  determine if you should or can do business. This is beneficial not only to us, but to  the prospect because we then have enough information to work smart and decide  whether the sales process is going to be profitable for both of us or a waste because there is nothing there for either of us.  We ask questions for three specific reasons: 1. Discovery-we need pertinent information ASAP! 2. Control-the person asking the questions with finesse can direct or lead the discovery and work smart to get to the bottom line fast. 3. Motivation-it can be discovered or created. Prospects need to get involved and  excited in order to give you the order today. We need to change a passive prospect  to someone ready to take action today!  Questions for you, Mr. Silver, are the force that will propel you to ascend our staircase and get the sale or for you to decide to make a quick exit. We ask questions  because they allow the prospect to become involved in the sales process and to do  more talking than we do. This is usually not the case in modern sales where the  salesman never shuts up. There is another perk to asking questions, it allows us to  make the critical decisions in the sales process. We get to decide whether to spend  time or end the conversation. Hold on Max, you just lost me. Why on earth do you want to end the conversation?  All the books, seminars and trainers always emphasize that you should go for the  ‘yes’. Close-close-close and spend as much time as you can or need with the prospect. What am I missing here? Let me ask you a tough question, Leo. Can you sell everyone? Can you close 100%  of the people you speak with? Of course not, Max. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 41

## Page 42

Correct. So why take on the attitude that you can? Sales is an intellectual, strategic and specific process, not a numbers game. Think about how much time you  waste on prospects who will never buy from you because they don’t have the need,  money or are incapable of making any decisions or commitments. Ask yourself this Leo,  When should we ask questions? No particular time Max, I just ask questions when I feel like it. My priority is to  give my presentation as soon as possible. I was always taught to get in front of the  prospect and give my product/service presentation as soon as possible. Questions  or qualifying is Ok, but not the priority. Dazzle them with my footwork, you know  what I mean? Exactly, but where did it get you? Not anywhere close to the sales and dollars that I need. Exactly, my boy. Here is a new rule for you: No specific information is given by  you until you have determined that there is a profitable reason for doing it. Wow, Max, what will I have to talk about if I can’t do my spiel about my product  line? That’s your mistake Mentee, but it’s not uncommon. Most salespeople usually just  wing it and ask questions when they feel the need, nothing planned. In the  G.U.T.S.© Method you do everything for a purpose, at a specific time, for a specific  reason. This is surgery with a laser scalpel. Your sales are now being transformed  to an exact science with some finesse. Leo, the only thing you have of value for  your prospect is your product knowledge, so don’t give it away. Secondly, the same  speech all day to people who are willing to occasionally listen, but have not been  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 42

## Page 43

qualified, is a waste of time. I consider it emotionally draining, redundant and unbelievably boring. I want you to first understand that all of your qualifying questions should be  asked in the very beginning of any sales discussion.  You ask your questions from the very onset of your conversation and get your answers in a step-by-step method. You will need to think about what information you  need, what is the inclination of the prospect, their level of motivation and their  ability to purchase, finance and follow through with their commitment. You will  qualify for need, money, time, commitment, whatever you need and make a sale or  make an exit.  What kind of questions should we ask, Max?  There are many types of questions and different ways to ask them. Here are a few:  open and close ended, negative and positive, opposite re-direction with finesse, I  don’t know questions and many more.  I never heard of these. I didn’t realize that there were multiple types of questions,  Max. Let me demonstrate a few and how you use different questions at different times for  different results. Let’s begin with the simple close ended questions. This type of  question usually calls for a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’ response. Let me ask and then you respond. Leo are you happy with your existing supplier of widgets?  Yes, Max! You responded in the manner I planned with just a one word answer. If you require  a more complete answer then use open ended questions. This will be the type of  response where you get the prospect more involved and elicit information from the  answer other than a ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Leo, let’s try an open ended question. What is the  turnover for your inventory on a monthly basis? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 43

## Page 44

Well Max, we need at least 10,000 widgets a month in order to keep our distributors properly supplied. As you can see Leo, you gave me a fuller answer with greater detail which might  be useful in our qualification and motivation process. The goal is to get the prospect more involved and more open with the information that can help both of you.  As you know, it’s rare for a sales person to ask questions and listen.  Hey Max, wait a minute, I just thought of something. What do you do if the prospect starts asking you questions and takes away your control? Excellent question, my boy and that calls for you to use one of our most potent  skills which I call re-direction questions. This where you answer a question with  another question thereby regaining control, continuing the discovery process and  getting the prospect motivated. Redirection allows you to maintain constant control  of the sales conversation. It will take practice, but if you use this tool correctly you  will be totally empowered, remain highly productive and prosperous as well as  free of intimidating prospects for the rest of your life. This is the most powerful technique that you can utilize within the G.U.T.S.© Method and it’s necessary if you wish to ascend the staircase of success. If you are  the person who is asking the questions, then the prospect will be doing most of the  talking and the work. Questions will get your prospect involved and may even flatter him by your request for greater involvement. Remember most salespeople talk  incessantly, listen selectively and ask few questions. If your re-direction questions are done correctly, the prospect will become involved in a more than a logical sense. She will become motivated, perhaps even  passionate concerning the subject matter at hand.  As a matter of fact, she will become so involved in the subject matter she won’t  even notice the fact that you have regained control and have redirected the conversation. Leo, let’s start by you asking me an open ended question. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 44

## Page 45

Leo: What color widgets do you have? Max: That’s an excellent question, Leo. If you don’t mind me asking, why is the  color of our widgets so important to you right now? Leo: Because we really are having a hard time with our current supplier being  able to obtain blue #2 widgets. Notice Leo that I immediately answered your question with a re-direction question.  I also added some finesse to the redirect question. This is called re-direction with  Finesse. In many a case, when you ask a question you will find that the prospect  may give a partial or a generic answer and not really the information that you  wanted. Prospects usually hold their poker cards very close to their chest. The  prospects are unwilling, in many cases, to be forthright in their answers to your  probing questions. They are either mistrusting of you, the salesman, or just feel  that a cursive answer will serve the purpose of a response. You will find in many  situations you will have to dig a little deeper to get to the truth. The information  you really need may require you to find the need to redirect two, three or more  times to eventually get to the truth or the information you need to qualify the prospect. Let’s go back to our role play Leo and begin again, but this time utilize the redirection plus finesse principle. Go ahead, Leo ask me a question and watch how I keep  probing deeper in order to elicit the core of your real needs. Leo: Max what color do your widgets come in? Max: Interesting question, Leo. Why is the color of our widgets so important to  you? Leo: Well, we will need half of our shipment in blue and the other half in red.  Max: I’m curious, please help me to understand. Why this combination of colors? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 45

## Page 46

Leo: These are our most profitable product lines. Max: Has this been a problem for your company with your existing supplier? Leo: You bet, a very big problem. We won’t even consider anyone unless they can  supply these colors in the next 30 days. Max: So in order for us to do business, we would need to be able to fulfill those  needs? Ok, let’s stop the role-play here, Leo. Do you see that by redirecting and getting the  customer more involved, I received a ton of pertinent information on what I need to  do in order to close. You got involved in the process. The pressure was all on you to  get to a different level. This is what re-direction is all about. In a traditional sales  call, the salesman would have begun a presentation very early on and would not  have had the benefit of all of the additional information so freely given by the prospect. This is great, Max! I am receiving unique information, I can control the sale and I  still haven’t sounded like a salesman giving a presentation. I sound more like a  doctor or lawyer making a diagnosis. Truly awesome stuff here, Max. Wait Leo, it gets even better. Now, let’s talk about adding some reverse psychology to this process. This is a psychological technique where you appear on the surface  to be asking a question in an unexpected way, but in reality you have the prospect  give you the answer or response you desired or were hoping for.  You lost me again here, Mentor. Listen carefully, Leo. To salespeople who are unfamiliar with the reverse psychology form of selling you are going in the wrong direction. In reality you are applying a very sophisticated and scientific technique in professional sales to elicit the  response you want, to keep the prospects off balance and to lead them to their own  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 46

## Page 47

logical conclusions. Let me demonstrate this concept for you. You just listen and  I’ll play both roles.  Prospect: Your product looks great! Salesman: Thank you, but I didn’t think you really liked our line of widgets. (Reverse psychology or opposite re-direction.) Prospect: They look fine especially the new x-12 line. I think they might lower our  maintenance cost. Salesman: It’s very interesting that you like that particular line. Has maintenance  cost be an area of concern for you lately? Prospect: I just received a memo from the head office that we have to lower our  maintenance cost by 10% or more for the next budget year. Salesman: You wouldn’t consider changing companies just to save 10% would  you? It can’t be that urgent? Prospect: Are you kidding me! It came from the corporate headquarters, so yes, it  is urgent. Can you guarantee me maintenance savings if I give your company a  shot at my next order? Salesman: If I could, what would happen next? Prospect: You’d get the order for 50 thousand widgets! The prospect now has to defend his position/statement and continue to praise my  products. I am making the prospect do the selling. Makes selling fun, doesn’t it? If  you want the prospect to respond in an affirmative manner you might go in the opposite re-direction. Leo, let’s switch gears and I will demonstrate with a sample  conversation using the positive re-direction. It’s the same thing, but with a different spin. Again, just listen. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 47

## Page 48

Prospect: Can you supply us with widgets? Salesman: It was my understanding that you had a supplier and they were doing a  good job for a reasonable price, right? Prospect: I wish. They have a problem with on time deliveries and they keep raising their prices. Do you see, Leo, how this positive question forces the prospect to usually reply in  the opposite direction and give more information to me or even a commitment for a  purchase? If you learn when and how to redirect both in the positive or negative,  when necessary, you will become a helluva sales professional. This is great stuff, Max! I didn’t see or better said, hear the moves that you made.  This Method is pretty stealthy. It’s supposed to be, Leo. There is one more re-direction technique to tell you about  which is my favorite. It consists of three words that allow you to gain control, get  more information and have tons of fun. Ask me a question, Leo and I will demonstrate. Make it any question that comes to mind. Leo: Ok Max, tell me how your line of widgets can increase my production. Max: I don’t know. Leo: What do you mean ‘you don’t know’? You’re the salesman aren’t you? Max: When I said I don’t know, I meant I don’t exactly understand the nature of  your problem, so I don’t know if our widgets are what you are looking for. Why is  your production of concern to you right now, Leo? Let’s stop the role play so I can explain what I am doing. See Leo, this is the “I don’t know” redirect step and it will force you to give me more information. I am  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 48

acting ignorant on purpose rather than to babble on aimlessly. This is a move very  few, if any, so called ‘sales gurus’ will teach. The salesman is always supposed to  be a walking repository of free information for his prospects. By acting ignorant  you get the prospect involved and you redirect the conversation so that all of the  pressure is where it belongs, on the prospect! Oh my gosh, Max. I never realized that there are so many ways of qualifying, getting information and receiving commitments without giving old fashioned and  tacky sales presentations. Don’t take this wrong Mentor, but what’s the downside to  this stuff? Well, the old Mentors’ G.U.T.S.© Sales Method will allow you to have fun, hold  your head up high and create unbelievable wealth if used correctly, but you’re correct, there is a catch, Leo! What is it, Max? It takes time and discipline to learn. You have to practice it on a regular, daily basis so that it becomes automatic for you. It is not intuitive for most sales professionals to ask G.U.T.S. questions unless they are trained to do so.  Do you mean like a doctor doing a diagnosis with a patient or an attorney meeting  a new client with a legal issue? Exactly, my boy! They need information in order to provide the best service. You,  as a professional salesman, can do no less. You can’t treat a disease without knowing the symptoms. You can’t defend or advise a client without knowing the issues.  You can’t be a problem solver for a prospect or sales client without having the pertinent information, the control of the sales process and a passionately involved  prospect. Questions are the answers to working smart and achieving your financial  sales goals, Leo! The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 49

The Price of Change Max stood up from the table and stretched his arms. I don’t know about you Leo, but all of this talking has left me with a little cabin fever. I think we need to get some fresh air and some good food. I bet there is a foot  of new powder on ol’ Mary Jane today.  Up for a little adventure, my boy? Max asked coyly.  Max, the last 24 hours has already been an adventure for me. What or where is this  Mary Jane? It’s only the best skiing in Colorado, top of the world, 12,000 feet high. Are you  game? Leo nodded his head in agreement. Then let’s go. Before Leo could react, Max had grabbed his Columbia jacket and shot for the  front door. Leo, hurried along in order to catch up and ran through the open door. Out in the front of his home, Max was already seated in a new shiny black Cadillac  16. The car was like nothing Leo had ever seen before. He had just read in a  magazine that there were only 1000 of these cars made every year. They contained  a 1000 horse power, 16 cylinder engine and every new state of the art devices one  could imagine. The car cost more than he had made in the last 7 years. He thought  to himself that there seemed to be no limit to this man’s wealth, yet he never gave a  clue of being pretentious about his success. Leo seated himself and the door was  closed by the house servant, Hans, who Leo had met the other evening. Hans walked over to the other side of the car to speak with Max. Excuse me Sir, but  will you and your guest be returning home for dinner this evening? I think not Hans, you had better say goodbye to Mr. Silver as you won’t be seeing  him for some time. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 50

## Page 51

Goodbye Sir, it was a pleasure. Hans tipped his hat from Max’s side of the car. Max revved up the powerful car and peeled out of the driveway. Leo could not believe the hairpin mountain roads that they were traveling on and worse Max  seemed to want to get as much speed as possible. He was grateful when a mere 5  minutes later they arrived at the hotel located at the base of the magnificent Winter  Park mountain. A valet, in a red uniform, upon recognizing Max’s car ran up to  greet them. Mr. Max, a pleasure to have you with us again, Sir. Thank you, Carlton. Please take your usual care of my car.  My pleasure Sir, I will have her washed and waxed by the time you are ready to  leave. Max deftly placed some cash into the valet’s hand. Thank you Sir, enjoy your stay. As they walked into the beautiful hotel lobby with rustic mountain decor, Max was  greeted by the hotel manager. Wonderful to have you with us again, Sir, the manager smiled. Is everything in order, Joseph? Max inquired. Yes, Sir. All of your arrangements have been made. If you will follow me I will see  that you are taken care of. Max and Leo proceeded to a ski shop in the hotel lobby. Leo was shown to a dressing room where a new ski outfit, silk long underwear and turtleneck, helmet, goggles and gloves awaited him. He proceeded to get dressed in the shiny blue and  black outfit. A large man with an Austrian accent took Leo to be fitted with a new  set of Nordica ski boots. Finally done, Leo felt like Frankenstein as he clunked  outside to meet Max by the chairlift. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 51

## Page 52

Leo contemplated what a radical turn his life had taken in the last 24 hours since  he had spoken with Nolan Smith. He was far from home, living in luxury, learning  new skills, a new mindset and now skiing in the Rocky Mountains. It was so much  to comprehend. His life was changing for the better and he knew it was only the  beginning. Max was waiting for Leo in a similar ski outfit and was wearing some very odd  looking short skis. Clamp on your Salomon snow blades, Leo and let’s go skiing!  Leo did as he was told and put on the very short rounded skis. He had skied a few  times in college, but he never considered himself proficient in the sport. They took  off for the chairlift after the attendant scanned the season pass that Max had provided Leo and attached it to his jacket. They got off at the top after a 13 minute express ride. It was beginning to snow  again and he was hoping he would not make a fool of himself. It had been many  years since he went skiing and the mountain or better said, the hills he had skied on  previously were more like sand dunes with ice compared to Winter Park and its  copious amounts of champagne powder. Leo at first was unsteady on the shorties, but after a few minutes of skiing he felt  confident enough to start enjoying himself. Max, of course, was an expert in skiing  as he was in so many things. Leo watched as Max skied like a figure skater making  multiple tight carving turns on the silken snow. He even did a few 360 degree turns  and occasionally skied backwards in order to keep an eye on Leo. They took another chairlift to the top of Parsenn Bowl which has a breath taking  12,000 plus foot view of the mountain that was carved out by the forces of nature  millions of years ago. Leo could see the awesome view of the Rocky Mountains  and was taken with the shear beauty of it all. Max interrupted Leo’s moment of contemplation while the chair was slowly making its way up the mountain. Leo, are you enjoying yourself? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 52

## Page 53

Max, this is quite a life that you have created for yourself; houses, jets, cars, fine  food, skiing. Of course, I am enjoying myself. As a matter of fact, I am having the  time of my life. I want to have this kind of life and more. Good for you, Leo, Max quickly responded. Never be embarrassed for wanting to  enjoy life to its fullest and all it has to offer. You can do more good for yourself and  many others by being prosperous as long as you keep your feet on the ground. My  Mentor always used to say that “money makes a good man better and a bad man  worse”. The question you need to ask yourself is, are you ready to pay the price for  your success? What price do you mean, Max? The price to you will be change. You are going to have to learn my teachings of  sales and implement them quickly. In many cases, you will be uncomfortable doing  things differently than you are used to, but the rewards will change your life forever. You will always be free; free to be your own man, free to do the right things at  the right time, free to live your life with quality and positively affect others. Everyone wants success, but few are willing to pay the price, the price of change or reinventing themselves to be better, work smarter and do what others are unwilling to  do. You have to realize that you will have to work smarter and be bigger and better  than your peers. Most people search their entire life for financial freedom and  never realize that they have everything they already need right in front of them. All  they have to do is utilize someone else’s success, learn their methods and implement them. It is everything that The Ancient Society of Mentors stands for. Most  people start from scratch, work very hard with the best of intentions and eventually  become complacent or frustrated with their lack of progress. My job as your Mentor, is to teach you a method of communication that has an understanding of the science and the art of human behavior in a systematic method  where the results are predictable and consistent if you employ them correctly. Just  remember Leo, there are a few enlightened salespeople who have unlimited earnThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 53

ing capabilities and who have a ball doing something they love while helping others with their quality products and services. All you have to do is learn these methods and be willing to pay the price which I discussed earlier. There was a moment of timed silence as it appeared that Max wanted his words to  have a serious impact on Leo. The only sounds were the gusts of wind and blowing snow. As the chairlift approached the top and they prepared to unload Max  looked at Leo and spoke. Enough of all this serious talk, it‘s time to have some fun.  My boy, you are in for some of the best powder and tree skiing you have ever experienced. Let’s head into the bowl and carve up the mountain. Then we’ll make our  way into the trees and do a little glade skiing. Stay close, ski fast and realize that  this is the best time of your life amidst all this beauty. They started out skiing the massive natural mountain bowl making artistic lines  into the fresh powder. Max took Leo into the glade, the tree runs, as he had promised and they gracefully skied in and around the tightly grouped pine trees. Leo  was glad that he was wearing a safety helmet. He was using all his physical  strength to keep up with his senior teacher. He was breathing hard due to the  physical exertion and the thin air, but he found himself having the sensation of flying and shouting for joy as the snow flew around him. Max was always in the lead floating through the powder with the grace of a ballet  performer. Leo was amazed that someone of Max’s age could exhibit such untiring  form. He was an exceptional man in many ways. It suddenly occurred to Leo that  Nolan had the same positive spirit. They finished the ski run and took a chairlift to  another section of the mountain. Just as he was thinking that it would be nice to  take a break, Max announced, now my boy, you are really going to do some skiing.  Max navigated them to a wide slope with huge moguls. It was all Leo could do to  keep Max in his vision as the old man had the skill and stamina of a 19 year old.  They managed several runs in different areas of the challenging mountain and finally worked their way to the base of Mary Jane to an enormous log constructed  lodge. Max, as usual, was personally greeted, this time by a smiling effervescent  hostess whose name badge read “Loretta”.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 54

## Page 55

They were brought to an alpine style table with white linen. A vase of columbines,  the state flower, sat in the middle. Max and Leo were surrounded by large windows  that gave them a view into the winter wonderland and all the skiers speeding down  the slopes. A waiter with a New Zealand accent came to the table. Hi Max, we have  elk stew today. No thanks Walter, I think we will have the usual, Max replied graciously. You got it, came Walter’s snappy confirmation. In less than 10 minutes, Walter brought them steaming plates of the largest cheeseburgers Leo had ever seen. There was at least a pound of meat on a fresh baked  french roll, infact it was more like a meat loaf than a cheeseburger. It was dripping  in cheeses, bacon and onions topped with lettuce and tomato. On the side was a  combination of oversized french fries, beer battered onion rings and coleslaw. Eat  up my boy! It’s not exactly health food, but it’s hot and filling. Gentlemen, I trust all is to your satisfaction, Walter inquired upon his return. This is the best burger I have ever eaten, Leo quickly replied. What do you do to  make it taste like this? Thank you, Sir. We are very proud of the quality of our food. Our burgers are a  combination of the finest beef, pork and lamb with melted French Brie cheese on  top and freshly grown local tomatoes and lettuce all covered in sautéed onions,  fresh ginger and garlic. The roll is fresh baked in the morning by our pastry chef.  Would you like me to have the recipe sent to your home? Walter asked Leo. Thank you, answered Leo, that would be great.  Leo and Max resumed consuming their lunch with much gusto while talking about  skiing between mouthfuls. Leo could only finish a quarter of the meal and had the  waiter brown bag the rest.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 55

## Page 56

Max personally went to the kitchen to thank the chef. Upon his return to the table, he told Leo that they would leave. Let’s catch a short power nap at the hotel.  They skied over to the hotel and Leo was escorted to his suite. Once again new  comfortable clothes were laid out on the bed for him. He found a note on top of  the pile which read:   Meet us in the lobby cofee shop at 2:30 PM sharp. Max   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 56

## Page 57

The G.U.T.S. Staircase  Leo took a long hot shower to ease the soreness in his muscles from all the exercise he had had in the morning skiing the Jane. He applied some Tiger Balm that  Max gave him when he complained about his discomfort before they separated for  their individual suites. The Mentor said it was a miracle salve that he discovered on  a trip to Shanghai and aside from the strong smell, it worked great. Leo slept  soundly for an hour until he received his wake up call by the hotel phone system. He hurriedly dressed and ran to the elevator to be on time. As he walked out of the  elevator, he saw Nolan and Max sitting on a comfortable looking overstuffed sofa  in the lobby coffee shop drinking a couple of tall cafe mochas. Nolan greeted Leo  and then they all sat down around a small table in a quiet corner of the coffee shop. Max began. Ok boys, enough of the small talk, let’s get down to the nitty gritty.  Leo, our previous conversation explained the G.U.T.S. philosophy, the utilization of  human behavior and gaining discovery by asking smart questions with redirection.  The G.U.T.S. Selling Method is broken down into three simple steps which I will  illustrate. I will summarize each step which we will then discuss. Nolan and I will  demonstrate or what I refer to as ‘role-play’ so you can see how each step is placed  into action and how all the supplemental rules and sub-steps are applied. The logic  of using this method in a step-by-step progression is that it will become second nature to you. Max grabbed a brown coffee shop napkin and began to draw a staircase.    _/3 Commitment Step   _/2 Qualify Step  _/1 Agenda Step   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

## Page 58

Max looked up from drawing and explained to Leo, your job will be to guide the  prospect through the process, do much less talking than you are used to, have fun  and perhaps most importantly, feel no anxiety or pressure. Sales will become more  like a chess game where you have strategic, well thought out moves rather than  blind man’s bluff. You will be using all of your resources and nothing is wasted. After I feel that you have competently learned my methods you will be faced with a  new challenge in order to satisfy me and The Ancient Mentors that you have properly learned the secrets of financial success which I am sharing with you today. Max looked directly into Leo's eyes with a stern look on his face and spoke with a  great seriousness in his voice. When we have completed all the steps or lessons you  will have to enter and defeat The Gauntlet! What on earth is The Gauntlet, Max? Leo questioningly sputtered. Max immediately looked at Nolan and smiled. Aha, I see my student knows how to  keep a secret and simultaneously create a little intimidation.  Nolan returned the smile and exclaimed, well Mentor, you didn't see the need to  tell me about The Gauntlet when I began studying with you until we were well into  our training. I figured the same should go for Leo. Leo knew something was going on, but he didn't have a clue as to what this Gauntlet was about. Heck, he didn't even know what a Gauntlet was. Hey guys, c'mon  and give a salesman a break, Leo pleaded. What is this gauntlet you both keep talking about? Leo grew sullen wondering if he would be able to survive The Gauntlet,  whatever it was. Max began. Simply said my boy, The Gauntlet is a test which The Ancient Mentors  decreed all mentees must face. It's a challenge of sorts that Nolan and I have devised. You will be placed in an unexpected situation in which you will have to use  all of your skills and of course, the G.U.T.S.© Method to succeed. If you pass or  better said survive, your life will change forever for the better, however, if you  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 58

## Page 59

fail........ Max hesitated after a moment of contemplation while stroking his chin.  As I was saying, if you fail then you will have to accept mediocrity as a way of life.  I would rather not dwell on that possibility, my boy. We can discuss more about  The Gauntlet later on. Let’s continue learning the Sales Method, Max ordered. It's time for you to learn  about our little staircase and the steps of success. Leo, the Method is comprised of  3 major Steps. As with any staircase, you start on the bottom. The first step and  each successive step you take will allow you to ascend to a higher level. As you go  up each step you get a little closer to making your goal or closing your sale. The  top step is where you profit. Each phase must be used in its exact order and no  step(s) can needlessly be skipped or eliminated. This is a logical progression that  will make sales within your control in a way you have never experienced. You see Leo, sales is not about jumping around being enthusiastic, memorizing  scripts or trying obvious embarrassing gimmicks and techniques. Sales is a combination of the science of human behavior and finesse. The person who takes the time  to learn the staircase of success will ascend to a wonderful place of self-esteem,  confidence and ultimate control of sales. Life for you will be wonderful. If you use  the staircase in the way it is designed, you will no longer have to memorize scripts  or use obvious closing techniques. In old fashioned traditional sales, the ultimate  goal is to gain a rapport or bond between the salesman and the prospect. Others  use another method called modeling where they parrot the body english, manner of  speech and tonality of the prospect in order to gain an edge. These are all very obvious and tired opening methods that most astute prospects are aware of. It may  work occasionally and gain you some advantages, but generally it’s a silly, obvious  game and as we both know, it doesn't work! Now, let’s examine the first step in our staircase called ‘the Agenda’.   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 59

The Agenda Step   or   Do you suffer from premature presentation?  _/ permission questions  _/ Road Map - setting the groundwork  _/ The Agenda Step Leo, Confucius said that “all journeys begin with the first step” and the G.U.T.S.© Sales Method is no different. In fact, our staircase is comprised of multiple steps.  This Method, at first, will appear deceptively simple, but as you study and learn all  its nuances you will see the genius of its organization. It’s something for you to  easily carry in your mind, memorize and refer to during the sales process. Your  competition has no such method. They are basically winging it and giving away  their time, knowledge and energy all day. The first step in our sales staircase is  called The Agenda Step. Leo, in order for a sale to get off on the right foot you need to gain trust, set the  tone for the way business is going to be conducted, get some preliminary commitments, understand the motivation and discover the needs of the people you want to  do business with. We do all this and more with The Agenda Step. Unlike the traditional salesman who can't wait to start showing off all his features and benefits, we  take a strategic approach. The Agenda is a roadmap for what is going to happen  in the sales relationship and it eliminates the haphazard guessing game and adversarial relationship that is traditional between the customer and the salesman. Our goal is to get control of the sale from the beginning and create an environment  of trust by being unbelievably honest, straightforward and upfront with the prospect. If it's going to happen, then let’s get things off to a good start. As in the case  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 60

## Page 61

of most sales, the sale doesn’t occur but, at least we know quickly and we can move  on to the next prospect. Leo, let’s think for a moment about how salesmen and prospects relate and interact. Simply said, the salesman wants to make a sale and in many cases is willing to  use obvious and high pressure and tricky tactics in order to accomplish his goal.  He will use transparent and charismatic techniques in the hope of gaining some  favor with the prospect. The old backslapping salesman who tells a bunch of jokes  is a dinosaur. The traditional salesman is still thinking that personality is more important than substance and veracity.  The prospect knows that these are transparent acts and that the salesman is out  there simply to make a sale for himself. The image of the car salesman comes to  mind, doesn't it, Leo? The prospect, as a result, remains noncommittal, manipulative and even lies if it serves his needs. Leo, The Mentors decided that they were going to change the entire sales relationship from the very beginning. It's all about both parties gaining an understanding  of what is about to happen and eliminate all the mind reading and second guessing. We have found that by being unbelievably honest and upfront with the prospect we will gain what is usually missing from most sales relationships and that is  TRUST.  We let the prospect know that we are here to help her and that it's all right for either party to end the conversation, sever the business discussion or continue it. I  like to consider this a form of what I call ‘reality sales’. What we don't want to  hear is the ‘think it overs’, ‘call me next weeks' and all the other delaying, noncommittal statements which mean ‘no’ anyway. You see Leo, most salespeople waste their most valuable resources; their time,  knowledge and energy on prospects who will never buy anyway. So why not do  both of us a favor and get rid of the unproductive prospects and concentrate solely  on the more likely clients? Let’s place the odds in our favor and make money more  often, with less effort and have a lot more fun. We set a standard, take control and  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 61

## Page 62

eliminate the fear of rejection because that decision is for us to make once we get  sufficient information from the prospect.  The idea propagated by motivation speakers and sales trainers is that all prospects  are a ‘sale waiting to happen’. This is nonsense because not everyone is willing or  capable of making a purchase at the time of a sales presentation. It is our job to  create an air of openness and forthcoming communication so we can determine in  the first few minutes whether or not our products or service are correct for the  prospect. Further, we have to know whether they truly have a need as well as the  finances and the ability to commit to us, too. Hold on for a moment, Max, Leo interjected. I like your ideas, but I don't have a  clue as to how I would accomplish everything you just said. What am I supposed to  say? ‘Hello Mr. Prospect, I want you to trust me’? These are just empty words,  aren't they? Exactly, my boy, that is why we have the “Baby Steps” to guide you and give you  some smaller steps to follow in the Method as well as give you organization. In  your head, you have memorized the first step, The Agenda. You understand the  need for getting the sales process off to a good start. You then break down The Agenda into substeps or what I refer to as the “Baby Steps”.  Max pulled out a yellow legal pad and drew the following diagram:    (The Baby Steps) _/ Permission Questions  _/ The Road Map   _/ The Agenda Step Max looked at Leo with those intense steely blue eyes and began his explanation. Leo, here is where we get into the meat and potatoes. Most salespeople go right  into a presentation as quickly as possible spouting off all of the information they  know which the prospect has no need for. Occasionally, they go for some pretentious, instant friendship, bonding and rapport which is a waste of time because it  lacks sincerity. Once we enter The Agenda Step we need to have a ROAD MAP.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 62

## Page 63

You wouldn't take a long car drive without knowing what route to take, would you  Leo? Of course not, Max. I usually call my auto club and get a well marked map. Exactly! Sales should be no different. If you went to a doctor, for instance, wouldn't  you like her to tell you about the procedure before an operation? Sure! Leo answered readily. Well then, it stands to reason that WE SHOULD TELL THE PROSPECT EXACTLY  WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO, EXACTLY WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN!  This is called setting up a road map. This allows us to remove all second guessing  and anxiety from the sales process. When you begin in any sales situation you must  set the tone or what we like to refer to as the road map opener. I am not sure what you mean, Max, Leo looked questioningly. Leo, this is where we explain to the prospect what is going to happen. We are direct, non-confrontational and we assert our intentions as a professional. It should  sound like this: ‘Mr. Prospect, I am glad we are meeting/talking today. I have found that in order  for me to satisfy and provide solutions to my customers, I need to ask a few questions to give me some direction as to why we are speaking. Then you may ask me  questions about my products/services and we will decide if there is a need for us to  do business or just call it a day until another time. Is that alright with you?’ Finally, the last baby step is to remove all pressure and tell the prospect that it's  alright to say ‘NO’! Let me ask you Leo, have you ever heard of a salesperson telling the prospective client that they can say ‘NO’? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 63

## Page 64

Heck no, Max. That goes against everything I was ever taught in sales. There are  even books and seminars devoted to how to get to ‘YES’. Why on earth would you  tell the prospect to say ‘NO’? Because my boy, this is a G.U.T.S.© Sales Method and by gaining a quick ‘NO’ you  can get out of the sales relationship quickly without expending any further time.  How many times have you encountered a prospect who lies to you, who says ‘well  let me think about it’, when doing business with you is the furthest thing on his  mind. They know that they will not do business with you, but are reluctant to say it.  They are uncomfortable with the word ‘no’ so they say things like, ‘I'll think about  it’, ‘call me in a month’, ‘send me literature’ and so on. Let’s get a small agreement or understanding going so that they can say ‘no’ or ‘yes’, but not the usual  uncommitted drivel that sales people hear all of the time. Leo jumped into the conversation, whoa Max, like I said earlier, this all sounds  fine here in the classroom, but .... But what does it sound like in a real conversation? Max interjected. Yes, Sir, Leo responded. Let’s role-play and I can demonstrate, Ok, Leo? Sure, answered Leo. Max smiled. You are now going to experience one of the best teaching methods  ever developed by The Society of Mentors and it's called role-playing. This is  where we practice hypothetical situations using the techniques mentioned in real  world conversations. We practice and practice so that when we use the actual  Method we are on automatic pilot. The words, the Method, the finesse come naturally to us. Let me demonstrate. I will be the salesman, you will be the prospect  and we will incorporate The Agenda and all of the baby steps. Max began. Max: Hello, Mr. Prospect. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 64

## Page 65

Leo: Hello, Max. Max: Thank you for inviting me here today. Why are we talking today, Mr. Prospect? Leo: I asked you here to tell me about your product/service for my company. Max: Thank you. Leo: Does your product come in green? Max: That's a great question and I fully intend to answer it for you, but before we  begin would you mind if I asked you a few questions in order to save us some time?  (Permission Baby Step) Leo: Not a problem Max, go ahead. Max: Thank you, Mr. Prospect. I have found that if I am allowed to ask a few key  questions then I can pinpoint if I can help you and your company with our products  and services. It’s necessary to know the needs of your company and basically why  we are talking today. What are you comfortable spending in order to solve the  problems of your company? What is the decision making process if we decide to  do business? My job is to find out if my product/service is right for your needs and  budget and if it can be provided in a timely basis.  (Road Map Baby Step) I want you to be comfortable telling me if my product or service is not what you’re  looking for. Is that all right with you, Mr. Prospect? If I can't determine this information, then there is no reason for us to do business today.  (Permission Baby Step) The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 65

## Page 66

Leo: Sure!  Max: You can say ‘No’ to me at the end of our conversation without hesitation,  correct? Leo: Yes. Max: Now mind you I would like you as a client, but I would rather that we both  have an understanding that I am here to make sure you have what you need and  don't feel pressured in any way. You wouldn't believe how many people used to say  ‘I'll think about it’ when they just meant to say ‘no’. Leo: I agree, Max. I appreciate your forthrightness. You wouldn't believe how  many salespeople I speak with think that if they try to pressure me, use tricky maneuvers or ask me for the order constantly, that I will acquiesce! Max interrupted. Off the role-play. Do you see Leo, what was just accomplished by  this simple step we call ‘Setting the Agenda’? Leo jumped in. Why yes, it seems that you told the prospective customer what was  going to happen before it occurred. You basically drew him a roadmap. I like the  way you also seized control so quickly without appearing to be tricky or manipulative. You gave me the impression that you were honest, not desperate or a beggar  and you had concern for my needs. Very cool, Max. What do you think of the way I asked the prospect to say ‘no’ if our products do not  meet his needs, Leo? That was the most curious move you made, Max. I have never heard a salesman  tell a customer to say ‘no’ like you just did. I felt like you were more concerned  about my needs rather than just trying to make an immediate sale. I felt as though I  could trust you. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 66

## Page 67

Exactly, my boy. Trust is a foundation of this G.U.T.S. Method. If there is trust, then  you and the prospect can move either forward or decide that there is no need to go  any further. But Max, aren't you concerned that the prospect will possibly say ‘no’ to you asking questions? So what? Max immediately responded. Who cares? You see, Leo there is a fallacy  in sales that every prospect is a potential sale when in reality nothing could be further from the truth. There is nothing wrong with the word ‘no’ as long as you get  to ‘no’ quickly. Imagine, if you got all of the ‘nos’ out of the way. Then you would  have more time for the prospects who are worthy of your time. By the way, Leo, I  am going to let you in on a little secret; they never say ‘no’ to a reasonable request.  In fact, most prospects hate to say the word ‘no’. Sales is not overly difficult if you  concentrate on people who have wants or needs or who have the capability to buy.  Unfortunately, most salespeople waste their time on unproductive sales calls.  Common sense tells us that we are in sales to MAKE MONEY yet most so called  ‘sales professionals’ waste their time on unproductive activities. The old fashioned way of sales is to make pretentious and obvious conversation in  order to make the prospect like you. The prospect knows what you are doing and so  does the salesman. It’s a silly little game about the pretense of instant friendship. I  am not there on a social call, I do not want to make a friend and I could care less  about bonding and rapport. I am there to do business and make money with my excellent products and services. I would rather have the prospect’s respect and trust  than to play games. The typical sales training program teaches the salesman to give a firm and hardy  handshake, smile a lot, give eye contact and act enthusiastically. He then begins  the chitchat about the watercolor on the wall, the lovely family picture on the desk,  the golf clubs in the corner, the weather, basketball scores, et cetera. Meanwhile,  the prospect is waiting for the other shoe to drop. The prospect is thinking, when is  the salesman going to start manipulating, using tricks, giving the long presentation  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 67

## Page 68

with the slick closing techniques? All the while, the prospect is pondering, ‘how  can I get the information, prices and delivery time that I need?’ Max, everything you are saying makes sense, but what is so wrong with being  friendly with the prospect? It’s not that there is anything wrong with being friendly and developing a rapport  on a long term basis. We all know that relational selling is a cornerstone for repeat  orders, but to get started you have to gain trust and qualify quickly, retain control  and make money or get the heck out of the office or off the phone. The buyer, customer or prospect has a predetermined opinion of you, Leo because of all of the  unprofessional people out there with the wrong idea of what a salesman is. You  have to be different, think differently and act differently if you want to succeed.  There is no competition out there because you are now a very dangerous salesman  using all of the skills of human behavior to get to a positive end result for both of  you. Max put his hand on Leo's shoulder and gripped it firmly. Leo listen to me. If you  need a friend, then go buy a dog or join a social club! If you want to make money  then act like a true sales professional and have the G.U.T.S. to ask the tough questions, to take control and be willing to get the ‘NOs’ and the ‘I'll think about its’  out of the way, so you can spend time with the ‘YES’ prospects.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 68

The Qualifying STEP    _/commitment  The Baby Steps _/time  _/money  _/ Needs or Greeds  _/ Qualifying Step Here's your next rule Leo, ready? Leo picked up his pen and pad to take the next note and nodded in the affirmative. Let’s move on to the heart of the G.U.T.S.© Sales Method: The Qualifying Step. Ask yourself Leo, what is the information that you need in order to have an understanding of how to sell your prospect? Imagine that you were a mind reader, a telepath and before a word was spoken you knew the needs, motivations, pains and  problems of your prospect. You knew the availability of her funds and financing.  You could tell the time frame of her needs to be fulfilled and finally you would have  a clear understanding of the prospect’s decision and commitment making processes. Imagine that you had all this information prior to ever giving a lengthy and  time consuming, energy sapping presentation. What do you think the results would  be for you? Why, I would probably be one the most successful salesmen in the company, Leo  eagerly replied. Yes, my boy you would have all the necessary and pertinent information that would  enable you to determine up front, if your prospect is a serious buyer today or  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 69

## Page 70

someone who you should sever any further conversation with. You could address  your company’s products and services directly to the needs of the buyer. You definitely would become one of the most gifted and prosperous salesmen ever. There is only one problem with this scenario, Max. I have no such ability, Leo said  in a discouraged voice. That’s correct. The ability to read minds while an asset, is a gift very few, if any are  born with. Max confirmed Leo’s concerns. So why are we even discussing this voodoo, Max? Leo was really having doubts  about what he was doing with Max, not to mention what he was supposed to be  learning. Be patient and you will learn Mentee. While you have no such ability, you have the  next best thing, you have a Method where you can get the same results. Remember  that by asking the correct redirection questions with the right amount of finesse you can obtain all the necessary information voluntarily from your prospect. The  problem, Leo with the sales trainers of today is that they still think that salespeople  are on the planet to give sales presentations by using manipulative, high pressure  and dishonest techniques. Sales has to be more than a numbers game. It has to be  treated as a profession. In a profession, you have to give respect and you must have  respect. This is no different from any other professional doctor, lawyer and so on.  The presentation is only given when you have enough information to close. Closing  with G.U.T.S.©, as you will learn later is completely different from what you have  been doing.  What do you mean, Max? Leo was really lost. In our Method, you never ask for the order, rather you lead the prospect to the  logical conclusion where they give the order to you. Everyone loves to buy, but few  like to be sold. We will discuss this more later on, my boy. For now, let’s get back to  getting enough qualifying information, Leo. How do you get that information? We  now know from our previous chat that you have to ask questions in a certain way in  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 70

## Page 71

order to qualify the prospect, classify him as someone we can do business with or  someone who is wasting our time as well as his. Max, excuse me for interrupting, but if we are asking all of these questions of the  prospect and they have questions and resent us asking them all of this stuff, what  then? Good point, Leo. Questions must be asked in the proper way in order for it to work  to our benefit. Before we discuss that, you have to understand that the salesman  has rights in the sales process. You are not a subservient second class citizen, you  are a pro. Imagine if you were injured and went to a doctor. Would you mind if she  asked you questions in order to determine the best way to treat you? Why no, Max, I wouldn’t mind at all. Well, as a professional salesperson how can you assist a potential client without a  certain amount of pertinent information? You can’t, Max. Exactly and that goes for all of the other professionals. We need to elevate the sales  profession to a different level and that all begins with you, Leo. Now back to your  original question about asking questions. Yes, potential clients can be abrasive and  downright irritating if they are not asked questions in a certain way. Remember, if  you ask questions be sure to phrase them in a way so as not to repel the prospect,  but rather in a way that is complementary. You need to reward and engage the  prospect in the conversation. Ask me a question, any question Leo and then you  will have a better idea of what I mean. Ok, Max, I’m game.  Leo: Why does a rainbow have so many colors? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 71

## Page 72

Max: Probably because the sky is so boring without them, Leo. Why are you asking me about the colors in rainbows? Leo: I saw one the other day over the mountains. Ok, Leo, let’s stop here. Did you see how I finessed the question in order to get you  to respond and for you to volunteer further information? Do you get my point, Leo  about how to ask questions with finesse? That’s a great move, Max! I think that I am beginning to see what you are trying to  demonstrate to me. Leo, my boy, let’s discuss what we really need to know in order to qualify the potential client. The qualifying step is broken down into at least four baby steps. It is  designed to make you think about what you need to do before you do it. Let’s take a  look at the first substep of qualification. Needs: What are the needs, wants, desires, hurts and motivations of our prospect?  Leo, did you ever wonder why people buy things? What is the underlying human  behavior that makes someone decide to part gladly with their money and purchase  a product or service? I never really gave it much thought, Max. I figured that people buy stuff when they  need it or when they are sold on the features, benefits, sizzle and so on. Wrong, my boy, Max shouted. People buy things because they have a present or future need that is causing them discomfort, aggravation and more. Many prospects,  as we know are really not prospects, but rather tire kickers, looky lous or suffer  from the malady of ‘paralysis of analysis’. They are basically very low on the  needs grading scale. Whoa there Max, you just lost me. What on earth is the needs grading scale? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 72

## Page 73

Sorry Leo, I was moving a little fast. Imagine a scale that is numbered from 1 to  10. Here let me draw you a diagram. Max proceeded to illustrate on the legal pad.  The Needs Grading Scale   1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10  1 thru 5 = low needs  6 thru 8 = some need and/or interest  9 thru 10 = high needs, passionate, urgency The scale is used for you to determine where your prospect is. Are her needs, emotional or painfully urgent with a sense of immediacy? Prospects who have no passion, usually have a lack of interest. They have no emotional investment, their  needs are low or nonexistent. People only buy things to escape existing or future  agony. It is only when their needs become so strong that they are willing to take an  action, be proactive and buy your goods or services. It is our job to act as professionals, Leo. This is a term that I take very seriously to  determine one of three things: One: Is there a need we can capitalize on and to what degree? Two: Can we expand or exacerbate that need? Three: If there is no apparent or obvious need can we create one based on our  product/service/specialty knowledge? You have to ask “need” questions. Max can you show me how you discover the needs? Of course, m’boy. We go back to our use of redirection, asking and answering questions with questions in different ways (positive, negative, ignorant, multiple  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 73

## Page 74

choice, etc.) to get the prospect so involved with their problems/needs that they  take an action. I want to introduce to you another great strategy called THE G.U.T.S. MOVE.  This is where you basically ask the tough questions and show the prospect that you  are a true professional and want to get to the bottom line. I will role-play both  parts and demonstrate. Max: Mr. Prospect, thank you for inviting me. Why are you interested in my company's widgets? Prospect’s Response: We just wanted to see what's out there in widget production. Max: Whose widgets are you using now, if you don’t mind my asking? Prospect’s Response: We are using ABC widgets. Max: They are a fine company, why would you want to look at anyone else’s widgets? Prospect’s Response: Well they are Ok, but they just had a very large price increase. (Possible need, but low on the scale - 1 to 3.) Max: Many companies had to increase their prices because of the increase in production costs. In fact, I believe my company's widgets cost even more than ABC’s.  Is price the only reason we are talking today because if it is, then I might as well  leave (a G.U.T.S.© MOVE) and let’s call it day. Would you agree? Prospect’s Response: Well there are some other issues. Max: Would you mind sharing them, maybe I can help? Prospect’s Response: Sure. We need reliable deliveries, that has been a real problem for us. (Needs increase, on the scale - 4 to 5.) The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 74

## Page 75

Max: All companies occasionally have delivery problems. I’m sure ABC is just  having a short term employee or maintenance issue. Prospect’s Response: I wish. This problem has been going on for 3 months and I  am really getting a lot of heat from the boss. (Needs now become more passionate,  on the scale - 6 to 8.) Max: When you say heat, what exactly do you mean? Prospect’s Response: I mean that if I don’t get the delivery problem taken care of  in short order, I am going to need a new job. (Needs are now 9 to 10. The prospect  has extreme agony, emotional distress with the possible loss of employment.) Ok, Leo what have you learned? Well Max, I can see that by constantly redirecting the conversation, you get to the  heart of the prospect’s needs. I usually don’t ask enough ‘need’ questions. I have to  learn to get to the heart of the prospect’s needs in order to do smart business. You,  on the other hand, hung in there until you got what you needed. You were direct,  bottom line and unconventional. You were in control and acted like a professional. Exactly Leo, you are really beginning to understand, m’boy. Max, it seems that now would be the time to close because we have uncovered the  prospect’s hidden needs and he has become involved in the sales process. Is that  correct? Leo asked.  In some cases, Max replied, that might be true, but what about the rest of the  qualifying baby steps that I showed you on the napkin? You mean the Money-Time-Commitment? Asked Leo. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 75

## Page 76

Exactly! This is a Method and we normally have to go through all the steps so as  to leave nothing to chance. I will address the other baby steps by continuing with  my role-play. Max: Mr. Prospect, would you mind if we talk about money? ($$$ baby step and  G.U.T.S. MOVE.) Prospect’s Response: Sure go ahead. Max: Assuming for a moment that we have a solution for your company, how are  we going to deal with the possible higher cost for your widget needs? Prospect’s Response: Can you deliver the widgets on time? Max: Let’s say for the moment that we can. Is your company prepared to pay a  higher price to solve this problem? (Redirection-question answered with another  question.) Prospect’s Response: If you can deliver the goods on time we can pay up to 10%  more. Max: Your company is budgeted for this increase? Prospect’s Response: No, not at this time, but I can temporarily borrow the money  from another department if I have to. Ok, let’s stop here, Leo. Did you see how we handled the tricky area of money? You bet I did, Max. I can’t ever recall talking about the money issue so early in the  sales process. It’s kinda refreshing to know where you stand and get the spendingmoney issues out of the way. Correct! Money should always be discussed early on. I can’t tell you how many  times so called ‘professional salesmen’ wait until the presentation is over only to  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 76

## Page 77

hear the prospect say something like “Gee, Mr. Salesman, I like your product and I would buy it if I had the money”. Why Max, that just happened to me a couple of days ago during a presentation  which I gave. I spent over two weeks doing research. I gave quotes and product information and the head buyer had the nerve to tell me that they were just shopping  around and couldn’t buy anything for a year. The company didn’t have the money  in the budget. The hard part for you to understand Leo, is that this was all your fault. You didn’t  properly qualify the prospect in the beginning and you didn’t ask the G.U.T.S.  Questions about money! It’s hard to admit, but you’re right, Max! I can see that in hindsight. Leo, let’s move on to the next baby step of the Qualification-TIME! Max: Mr. Prospect, based on what you have told me about your needs and those of  your company, would I be mistaken (opposite redirection) if I said that time is of  the essence (time baby step) in fixing the widget delivery problem? Prospect’s Response: No, you are correct. We do need a new supplier NOW who  can get us the widgets on time. See Leo, we now know without a doubt, that he needs the widgets ASAP! We have  identified the needs, money and time issues which are usually important factors for  the prospect. We don’t want to leave anything to chance when we are ready to  close.  Next we need to discuss the commitment stage, said Max.  What do you mean by the commitment stage, Max? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 77

## Page 78

Let me answer your question by asking you one, Leo. Have you ever had a selling  situation where you went through all of the motions and then you had the prospect  tell you that he “had to discuss the matter with another person in authority”? Oh sure, Max. I remember where I recently had a buyer tell me that he would ask  the head of the department for permission to give me a purchase order. I had to  give the presentation all over again, answer the same questions. It was a waste of  valuable time.  Correct Mentee. You have to find out, at the onset, who the right people are to talk  to, who makes the decisions and how the buying process works. How would I do that, Max? Let me demonstrate, Leo. Max: Mr. Prospect before I answer your questions about how our line of widgets  can solve some of your problems would you tell me about how your company  makes commitments in a purchase situation? Prospect’s Response: You give me the information and prices on the widgets and  then I write up and submit a request to the purchasing department to authorize a  purchase order to be sent to your company. Max: Do you have to speak to anyone else before you make your decision? Prospect’s Response: If the order is over 10K, I have to speak to my supervisor,  Mr. Kahn. Anything under that amount I can personally approve. Max: Since this order is going to be over 10K should we contact Supervisor Kahn  in case he has any questions for me? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 78

Prospect’s Response: Good idea. He is the inquisitive type and would probably  appreciate the gesture. Hold on while I call his office and arrange an on-the-fly  meeting. Leo, how many times have salespeople given a presentation, dispensed information, without qualifying the needs, money, time factor and then neglected to qualify the prospect concerning the commitment process for the purchase? It is necessary to learn how buying decisions are made up front, rather than to have rude  surprises. If you are going to be a professional, then you need to do a diagnosis on your  prospects. You are entitled, you have the right to do no less than a doctor or lawyer. You have to have the pertinent information to qualify the prospect in order to  help him or remove yourself from the sales process. There, we have covered the four important steps of qualification-needs, money, time and commitment. Phew, we have been here for quite some time. It’s a wonder  we haven’t been asked to leave. We still, however, have to discuss the last step,  naturally called The Close. Finally! Leo exclaimed. I don’t know about you Max, but I am famished.  You’re right, Leo. My apologies. I get so enthused teaching the G.U.T.S.© Method  that I lose all track of time. Let’s go back to our rooms and meet in 30 minutes in  the bar downstairs, we’ll have a couple of my famous Max Martinis, some canapés  and the best steak dinner you will ever taste. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

The Close Step   _/CCC (Close, Correction, Confirm)  _/Satisfy  _/Review  _/ The Close Step  The alarm went off with an annoying buzz and made Leo jump out of a deep sleep.  He looked at his watch and realized that he had fallen asleep on the gigantic  heated California waterbed after taking a long hot shower. He was physically and  mentally exhausted after all of the skiing and the intense lessons learning the  G.U.T.S.© Sales Method from Max. He had put his head down on the pillow and  was out in a flash.  He realized that most of his sleep was dreaming of a recent sales meeting with one  of his toughest buyers, Mort Swanson, who always gave him a hard time. He routinely kept him waiting even though they had appointments. He would barely grunt  a ‘hello’ before asking countless direct questions about products, prices, market  conditions and more. The meetings were unpleasant, to say the least and worst of  all he never got anything except an occasional, very small token sale. This was  only after being interrogated for all the market and product knowledge he had. He  was being used and he knew it, but he could never do anything about it. This dream, however, was different; it was Leo asking all the questions, looking  for need, money, time factors and commitment. He was the one in control and he  was treated with respect and courtesy. When he was done and decided that there  was insufficient business to warrant any further expenditure of time, he told Mort  that the conversation was over and that he would be leaving. Mort was just sitting  there with his mouth open like a big mouth bass. Suddenly Mort said, “don’t leave”  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 80

## Page 81

and remarkably Leo asked “why should I stay if we aren’t going to do any business?” Mort began explaining how he needed Leo and was willing to increase their  orders. Leo asked him if he was sure about his decision and then Bzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Why is it that the alarm always seems to go off at the best part of a dream, but  never during a nightmare, Leo pondered. He quickly put on some fresh clothes and  ran for the hotel elevator not wanting to be late for his next meeting with Max. As  he waited for the elevator doors to open he began thinking about the G.U.T.S.© Sales Method. It was intriguing to him because everything that Max taught was the  opposite of all he had previously been taught about sales.  In all of the role-plays, he gave no information on his company's features and  benefits until the appropriate time, he never asked for the order, but created a situation where it was requested by the prospect. Imagine, dealing with a prospect as  though he was in charge and could walk away in a second without regrets. How  could everything he was taught be so wrong and this strange old man so right, he  wondered? His world was upside down. He entered the hotel lounge and was  greeted by Max and Nolan. The trio was escorted to a small table where three  glasses greeted them. Leo, right on time; I like that. Here, have a Max Martini, one of my favorite drinks,  Max smiled at Leo as he handed him the glass.  What’s in it, Max?  Why Chopin Vodka made from Stowbawa potatoes with a few drops of Martini and  Rossi Dry Vermouth and a Trader Joe’s Jalapeño stuffed giant olive served in a  straight up Martini glass. It is perfection personified! From the pitcher, Max poured Leo a martini into the sparkling chilled tall stem  glass that Max had handed him just moments before. Nolan raised his glass and  made a toast, to the Mentor. Leo joined in and added Cheers! The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 81

Here, have some crab cakes. I just had them flown in from Chesapeake, Maryland,  Max said as a waiter served Leo three steaming crispy browned crab cakes with a  red chipolte sauce on the side. The spicy flavor of the sauce exploded in Leo’s  mouth. There was a moment of silence as all three savored their drinks and appetizers. A hotel employee approached the table and whispered into Max’s ear. In response,  Max looked at Nolan and Leo and said, Ok boys, the limo is here, let’s go get some  real prime beef. They stepped outside into the cold night mountain air. It was  snowing heavily again. Leo wondered how the locals felt about living in a place  where it snowed all the time. A stretch limousine pulled up in front of the hotel  and the driver opened the door. Leo felt like he was stepping into another world.  The interior car space was huge. It was lined in rich red fabric with real wood  paneling. It had telephones, a TV with satellite reception, a DVD player and a wet  bar with a complete stock of liquor. After they were seated and comfortable the  driver inquired, where to Mr. Max?  Take us to the Ruth’s Chris Steak House in Denver, please, we’re famished, Max replied. Leo was amazed that the old man was so thin and had the physique of a man half  his age. How did he do it? He loved to live and eat so well. Max directed his attention to Leo. Well Leo, ready to learn the third and last step of  our little sales method? Yes Sir, but I have one question, came Leo’s reply. Go ahead, m’boy. Everything you have taught me so far is so different from traditional sales techniques. Is the closing step going to be as different as everything else has been to  this point? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 82

## Page 83

That’s a fair question my boy, why don’t we let Nolan address your questions. Thank you Max, Nolan immediately replied.  Nolan turned to look directly at Leo. Leo, in the old days I was trained like everyone else, that is to say, to ask for the sale. As a matter of fact, I had one sales  manager who insisted that you never leave a presentation unless you have asked  for the order five or more times. We now know the following: 1. We don’t give away information because that doesn’t work. 2. We use a common sense direct approach to sales by asking questions and      redirections. 3. We are outspoken, frank, honest, unbelievably direct and expect the same in       return. 4. We don’t sell people, we assist them in making the decision to buy.  5. We work off their information and decide to invest the time or get out.  6. We work smart and have a blank check in front of us for the rest of our life. The modern prospect resents the obvious pressure by so called ‘contemporary  salesmen’ with phony bonding, friendship or rapport. The old fashioned way of  closing with the obvious and tacky moves is a dinosaur, Leo. It doesn’t usually  work and it’s a waste of time in the 21st Century. The funny thing about sales is  that a prospect who has gone through Max’s Method will want to buy from you or  literally give the sale to you without hesitation! Whoa there Nolan, interrupted Leo, did I hear you right? You said the prospect  will give us the sale? I thought the ABC golden rule of sales was to always be closing, to keep asking for the business. Now you’re telling me that this is all wrong?  You got it, Leo, Nolan answered with a smile. Excuse my ignorance, Nolan, but why would any prospect want to give me an order? Leo questioned.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 83

## Page 84

Because, Nolan replied, they have come to the realization that your product/service  can resolve their needs, within their budget, in a given time frame and within their  ability to make a commitment. It makes sense because it fulfills their immediate or  future needs. Don’t you get it, Leo? You closed them in the beginning instead of at  the end. I’m still lost, Nolan, came Leo’s hesitant reply. Excuse me Nolan, can I jump in here, Max stated more than asked. Sure Max, go ahead, Nolan nodded his head affirmatively. Leo you have to go back to our original premise of G.U.T.S. People hate the traditional sales relationship where they feel that they are out of their element and are  being manipulated and pressured. They hate to be sold by a tacky salesman.  Many people have this impression of salespeople so they have to protect themselves  by being evasive. They confabulate stories of spouses who need to be communicated with, the old “I need to discuss this with my husband/wife line” or they  have the need “to review the literature”, “think about it” and so on. The point of the entire method is to create an air of trust, respect and control. You  are asking questions and getting information in order to enable the prospective  buyer to come to their own conclusions that your product/service will solve their  needs or in the alternative, allow you to conclude business quickly. People hate to  be sold, but absolutely love to purchase things when they have justified their decision rationally. Max took a long sip of the cold Martini and pulled out the olive. A  penny for your thoughts, Leo? Well Max, I understand that it would be better if the salesman and the prospect are  on the same wavelength or side. I just don’t see why they would give me the sale. You have to understand Leo, that the prospect is no longer the enemy. It’s not the  game of cat and mouse or chess where we are trying to capture the queen. Sales is  not about being adversaries. As we discussed earlier, it’s more of a professional reThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 84

## Page 85

lationship. We have led the buyer to make a logical decision. The only way to alleviate his needs within his budget, in the necessary time, in his decision making capacity is for him to share information with us. The buyer needs to make his own  purchasing decision and it’s our job to help him get there or get out of the office or  off the phone. If we have done our job correctly they will give us the order rather  than feel cornered. We are professionals, our clients want to do business with us or  feel comfortable enough to be honest with us. Let’s go back to the staircase and keep things simple, Ok boys? Max pulled out his Sharpie© blue liquid ink pen and began to draw in his small binder. Here is the final step, AKA: the Close Step.    _/CCC (Close, Correction & Confirm)   _/Satisfy  _/Review   _/ The Close Step Max looked up and began. The first “baby step” of the close is to take the information that you accumulated  from the qualification step conversation and REVIEW it with the prospect. Leo jumped in. You mean the needs, money, time and commitment? Exactly! You need to review or summarize everything that you have heard and  learned. The purpose of this is twofold. First, you want to let the prospect know  that you have listened carefully and secondly, to keep him focused on what’s important to him. You want him to be so concerned with his needs that he will want to  take an immediate action with your product or service. The next baby step is to satisfy. This is your ‘presentation step’. This is where you  relate how your product/service can fulfill his needs. At this juncture, you use all  the information you have derived from the conversation with the prospect using all  your skills in questions or as I prefer to call it ‘discovery’. This is where you use  your skills to weave the needs of your buyer to the way your items/service can satThe Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 85

## Page 86

isfy. We are leading the buyer to come to his own natural conclusion and make the  decision to buy rather than be pressured with tackless and obvious closing techniques. The last baby step in our staircase is comprised of the actual close. It is comprised  of three parts; last question Close, Correct and Confirm. The last question close is the only closing technique that you need to learn. You have to ask a simple question and hopefully the buyer has come to the logical conclusion used to make the  decision to buy. In the old fashioned traditional sales the salesman is taught to ask  repeatedly in several obvious ways for the order. He becomes an annoying and obvious pest to the buyer who then needs to employ defensive techniques of his own. I recently read a book on so called ‘modern sale’s where the salesman was punished by his superiors because he asked less than 5 times for the order. What utter  nonsense! The prospect feels pressured and in many cases retreats to his own necessary defenses in order to regain his control. The last thing the prospect feels like doing is  giving an order. He just wants to get out. In the G.U.T.S. Method we never ask for  the order because we don’t have to, the prospect gives it to us because it makes  sense. It solves his problems. The art of persuasion is to lead the prospect to their  own natural common sense conclusion to buy your products or services. Let me do a simple role-play to demonstrate. Nolan, help me with this one. Max: So Mr. Prospect, the reason we are talking today is because you need to deal  with your current situation. You mentioned that your company has been held up  with deliveries of widgets because you can’t get enough #4’s in green. (Review  step.) Correct?  Mr. Prospect: Nolan nodded ‘yes’. Max: I believe that my company can supply your needs by next month if we decide  to do business. We have the ability to manufacture sufficient green #4 widgets if we  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 86

## Page 87

have a 14 day advance notice. (Satisfy step.) What would you like to do, Mr. Prospect? (Last question close.) At this point, Leo, you have received an order because you have set the agenda,  qualified the prospect properly and you have asked a reasonable last question close. Remember this Leo, never ask for the sale because it’s better to receive than  to BEG! Hey Max, Leo interjected. What do you do if they say that they need a quicker delivery time or they need to finance or just give some kind of stall or objection? We call that part of the close a correction. You either renegotiate and correct the  problem or you go back to their needs to create a greater sense of urgency. It’s basically the ‘put up’ or ‘shut up’ time in the sale. If it’s a new problem that can’t be  resolved, then ask the prospect if this is a deal killer situation. The ball is now in  his court and the close continues or it’s over. Assuming that there is no problem or the correction has been satisfactorily resolved, you hopefully have been given the sale or decided that there is no business  here for you. The only thing left to do is to confirm the sale; the final baby step. But Max, I thought you said that you already had received an order.  You’re right my boy, but how many times have you run off with a check or an order  only to discover that the prospect had second thoughts or remorse? More than I would like to remember, Max! Let me role-play again. Nolan jumped in. Max: Mr. Prospect, I appreciate that we are doing business and I thank you for the  order. You are comfortable with this decision, correct? Mr. Prospect: Yes. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 87

## Page 88

Max: If you have any second thoughts or are uncomfortable, I would appreciate  that we discuss it now. It’s still Ok to say ‘no’ or change your mind. (G.U.T.S.  Move.) Mr. Prospect: When I make a commitment, I keep it. Max: Thank you. I know that you are the kind of person who is a man of his word. End of our little closing demonstration, Leo. You see we have come to the close methodically. The prospect wants to do business with us because he is aware of his  needs and he wants them resolved. We can’t be mind readers, but using our question based Method is the next best thing. In three simple staircase moves, with all of the adjoining baby steps, we have  stayed in control, asked questions in order to have the sufficient information so that  we can decide whether we have a sale or a waste of everyone's time. We spend the  time with the correct prospect, qualify and eliminate the time wasters. We now  have the tools, in as little as 3 minutes to qualify a prospect, get out or decide that  as much time as necessary is justified here. Leo, sales is not about presentations, slick brochures and knocking on countless  doors. It’s about working smart, staying in control of the entire process, feeling absolutely great about yourself and having the ability to make as much money as you  are willing to. The hardest part about G.U.T.S. selling is that you need to make  monumental changes in how you perceive sales and with the methods and tools  that you use. That will be the hardest part for you. Are you going to commit to take  control of sales or let it control you because of some worn out misconceptions of  being subservient to people you intend to do business with? It’s time to work smart,  have fun and have unlimited financial freedom. Remember that sales is the million  dollar skill. Is this all I need to be as successful as you and Nolan? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 88

## Page 89

This is all you need, my boy. Just keep the simple 3 step staircase in your mind and  practice working through the Method, asking questions and redirections with finesse. One of three things will happen: 1. You reject the prospect early without wasting energy, time and valuable knowledge. 2. The prospect is qualified and you proceed because the situation is worthy of  your time. 3. Your close percentage goes through the roof because sales is no longer a mindless game, but a specific method. Leo, we have finished our review of the G.U.T.S.© Sales Method. You now have the  most powerful method ever developed in the art and science of persuasion. It will  take some effort to learn, but once you own it you will be financially free forever.  Let’s get some chow, I’m starving! The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 89

The Beginning The trio finally arrived at Ruth’s Chris Steak House and the limo delivered them to  the front door. There was a line that went out the door which appeared to be people  who were waiting to be seated. Max leapt from the car and walked into the restaurant. He glanced behind him and gave Leo and Nolan the “let’s get going look”.  Leo and Nolan decided that they better get a move on if they were going to keep up  with the energetic Max. Once inside, Leo noticed another long line leading from the fancy entrance. A well  dressed woman greeted Max as they approached the maître d podium. Why hello, Max, she exclaimed with obvious enthusiasm. We have your table ready  and our finest server will see to your every need. Is there anything else I can do for  you? Thank you, Gwen, I always appreciate your personal attention. You do a wonderful  job. Leo noticed that Max had handed Gwen a $100 bill. At first she had said it  wasn’t necessary and attempted to return it to Max, but he insisted and no one ever  seemed to argue with Max. They were immediately escorted to a beautiful white  linen table with a view of the Great Divide. A waiter came by with some menus,  but Max waved them off simultaneously saying, three New York Strip Steaks with  the works, please. Awhile later, Leo was amazed as the steaks arrived sizzling in hot butter. The servers warned them to place their napkins in front of their torsos so they wouldn’t get  burned as the custom designed Lenox plates were set in front of them. Next came  the huge bowls of broccoli, mashed garlic potatoes, creamed spinach, caramelized  onions, hugh french fries and more.  Leo realized that this was a cholesterol nightmare, but it was some of the best hot  food he had ever eaten. A bottle of Rodney Strong Merlot was brought to the table  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 90

## Page 91

and expertly poured into the beautiful wine goblets which were on the table. The  trio ate with relish using the oversized German made wooden handle knives. Every  bite was an explosion of taste in Leo’s mouth. Leo loved the good life. He felt  spoiled by the past 2 days. Previously his diet had consisted of macaroni and  cheese or Rice-a-Roni or whatever was on sale. The men were quiet as they finished their meal. The unusual silence at the table  gave Leo an uneasy feeling. He knew that Max and Nolan were about to spring  something on him. Eventually the silence was broken by Max as the plates were  being cleared. Coffee and some excellent Mexican brandy served in round crystal  snifters was brought to the table. Leo, Max began, we need to discuss your Gauntlet. So there it was, the mysterious Gauntlet again, Leo thought to himself. Leo, this will be our last meal together until you have faced and won The Gauntlet.  I have taught you a new way to sell and if you have the G.U.T.S. and intelligence,  as I know you do, your life will never be the same. You can have it all and never feel like a 2nd class citizen again in sales. You are  now in control of your life. Nolan and I will be excusing ourselves and you alone  will face what many before you have done as ordained by The Ancient Society of  Mentors. You must face your fears, defeat your dragons and take total responsibility for yourself. Nolan and I have seen to it that you have the tools to succeed, but  the rest will be up to you. So what is this Gauntlet you and Nolan keep talking about Max? Leo questioned. Max looked intently at Leo and began. My boy, you will be taken to a surprise destination. Upon arrival, you will be on your own to prove your comprehension of the  G.U.T.S.© Sales Method. You must find a way to utilize your new sales skills and  generate enough income to provide yourself with immediate food and shelter. Your  Gauntlet is to do more than to survive. It is to become independent and thrive in a  strange and possibly hostile environment, but it is also a place where, if you make  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 91

## Page 92

it, you can make it anywhere. In other words, m’boy you have 30 days to change  your life. You will start with almost nothing in your pocket and you must find a means to survive immediately. You will live off your wits and survival instincts. No one from my  staff will aid you in anyway. No one will rescue you or lend any support whatsoever, if you get into trouble or have no place to sleep. You are completely on you  own. You will find that the destination you are sent to is a place with unlimited opportunities. There is no room for second place which is considered failure, regardless. You will have one month to prove yourself to Nolan, myself and The Ancient  Society of Mentors. Most importantly though, is to prove to yourself that you can  do this, you can succeed. The next few days will determine if you are to become a  winner or continue a life of frustration and mediocrity. I wish you well in all your  endeavors. This is your Gauntlet. It’s time to make a decision; do you accept it? Leo felt as if his entire life came to this very point. What choice did he have? He  could go back to what he was doing, being a third rate widget salesman, with all its  poverty and humiliation or take the chance that was being offered. I accept The  Gauntlet, gentleman! Leo exclaimed this so loudly that the other diners turned  around to gawk. Max jumped up from his chair. Excellent! That’s the ticket m’boy! You picked a  good one here, Nolan. Max and Nolan both approached Leo, shook his hand and heartedly patted his  back. The guests at the adjoining tables couldn’t help but stare. In the end Leo, we  are all responsible for our own lives, our own success. I wish you well. If you  would please step outside and get into the waiting car. Now your adventure really  begins. ‘Oh boy’, Leo wondered to himself, ‘what’s going to happen to me now?’ The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 92

## Page 93

The Gauntlet  The limousine drove Leo for about an hour and then he was dropped off at an Embassy Suites hotel near the airport. The limo driver told him that he would be picking him up at 5:00 am sharp. All of the arrangements had been made for Leo as  usual including fresh clothing and toiletries which had been left on the bed in the  expensive room. He spent the next few hours in a restless sleep. At 4:30 am he received a wake-up call which came all too fast. The same limo and driver were waiting for him outside the hotel. After a short  drive, Leo was dropped off at DIA (Denver International Airport) where he was instructed to go to a special platform for private jets. Except for the two pilots and  one flight attendant, there was no one else on the plane. They flew for over four  hours. He was served a hot breakfast and before he knew it, he was reminded to  fasten his seat belt for landing. Leo didn’t have a clue as to where he was flown,  but it did appear to be a large modern airport as they taxied down the long runway.  As he walked down the plane exit ramp he was met by another black limousine.  The door was opened by the driver and Leo sat down wondering where the heck he  was; it was nerve racking to say the least. He tried to speak to the driver, but he  was ignored and the windows were locked. Finally, after an hour of driving in and  out of traffic the driver slowly pulled to a sidewalk. Leo decided to try the button  for the power window and it worked. As it glided down, he realized that he was  now in the heart of New York City, infact he was in Times Square. He knew this  place from watching TV on New Year’s Eve where the giant apple came down at  the stroke of midnight. He was excited and scared at the same time. The challenge of being alone and  broke in Manhattan, did not bode well with Leo. He did appreciate the opportunity  that Max and Nolan had bestowed upon him, but inside he thought to himself,  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 93

## Page 94

heck I'm still Leo Silver, sales failure. The driver interrupted Leo’s thoughts and  finally spoke. Excuse me Sir, but I was instructed to give you this from Mr. Max.  The driver handed Leo a sealed envelope. Leo rapidly opened it and found a note  penned on expensive French engraved stationery. It also contained a $20.00 bill.  The note read: My Dear Leo,  I am envious of the challenge before you. You might feel a bit scared at this  moment and with what lies before you, but please believe me when I say that  you have everything you need to succeed.  Enclosed you will find a $20.00 bill. I figured that by now you must be hungry.  Try the pizzeria across the street, it's fantastic. Good Luck!     Your friend,  Max Leo now knew that he had to prove to himself as much as he had to show Max and  Nolan that he could face and defeat The Gauntlet. He knew this was his opportunity to succeed in the way he had always envisioned for himself. Oh well, I might  as well get started, he thought to himself. As the saying goes, ‘Today is the first day  of the rest of your life’.   Leo slowly stepped out of the luxury vehicle into a throng of New Yorkers. Amazingly, no one seemed to pay any attention to him or to notice the car. He realized  that all he had heard about New Yorkers was true. They are always moving and  talking fast. This was after all, the Big Apple and limos were a dime a dozen in this  city of success. Max was right as usual, Leo was famished so he went across the street to the pizzeria just as Max had recommended and ordered a plain slice and an orange drink.  He sat down at the counter pondering just what he was going to do. Here he was in  New York City all alone with next to nothing in money and yet a self-made millionaire and a successful coworker felt that he was ready to succeed. The steaming  slice of cheese on a thin crust wrapped in a sheet of wax paper was served to him  with his orange drink in a simple paper cup. Wow, $3.50 of his $20.00 was gone.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 94

## Page 95

Leo knew that his remaining meager funds would not go far in a city where he  guessed decent hotel rooms started at $350.00. The pizza was way too hot to eat,  but Leo was too hungry to care. Max was right, the pizza was the best he had ever  tasted even if it did burn the roof of his month. The cheese was soft and chewy  against the thin crunchy New York style crust. Leo believed that he could live on  pizza alone. It was time to get down to brass tacks so he took a pen from his pocket and began  to write down some thoughts on a napkin which he had removed from the dispenser. Leo knew that he had to set some priorities and make a sales strategy plan  if he was going to survive, much less pass The Gauntlet. Oh well, time to get  down to business. He needed to generate some money fast if he was going to be  able to continue eating. There was also the problem of where he was going to  sleep tonight, but he’d have to think about that later.  All of a sudden there was a loud, animated conversation coming from the table  across from the counter where Leo was seated. Look Charlie, you can't just leave  me like this. You know we are having the big promotion this month. If we don't sell  our quota of cars we will lose our allotment and priority status with the corporation, not to mention our discount. Hey Herman, came the reply, sorry about the short notice, but a fella has got to  make a living. The guys over at Broadway Auto offered me my own office and more  money per car.  Trying hard not to stare, Leo noticed that the two men shook hands and the fellow  called Charlie, who was quitting, abruptly got up and left. Leo saw that the man  who appeared to be the boss sat shaking his head as if in deep thought. Leo got an  idea and figured that he better do something or he was going to sleep on a bench in  Central Park tonight. With great trepidation, Leo got up and approached the man  at the table. It was time for a patented Max G.U.T.S. move. Excuse me for interrupting you, Sir. I know that this is none of my business, but I may have a solution  to your problem.  Who the hell are you, Bud? Herman barked. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 95

Leo immediately thought to himself that he was definitely in the Big Apple and  that his idea wasn't going to be an easy sell. Well Sir, my name is Leo Silver and I  couldn't help but overhear your conversation. I just thought that I might have a solution for you if you want to hear me out, otherwise I will go back to where I was  sitting. Go ahead kid, pull up a chair, but make it snappy. I ain't got all day. Well Sir, I couldn’t help but overhear you with the other gentleman before. You do  need a new car salesman and I think we may be able to solve each others’ dilemma. Kid, I like your moxie, but have you ever sold cars before?  Nope, came Leo’s quick reply, just widgets. The only thing I know about cars is  how to drive them, but I have had some specialized sales training from my Mentor  Max and I do have a sales background. I have everything I need to know to become  successful in any sales profession. I have a G.U.T.S.© Sales Method. I don’t have a  resume of fantastic testimonials selling cars, but I am willing to make you the following offer. You have the right to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to me so long as you don’t tell  me you need to think about it. Can we agree on that one point before I make you  my proposition? Sure kid, go fer it! Leo took a deep breath and was beginning to feel like he would soak his shirt.  Here’s my proposition. If I can sell a car by closing time this evening you have to  give me a job and a cash advance on my sale.  Sounds good kid, but what if you don't make a sale? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 96

## Page 97

Leo responded so quickly he surprised himself. If I don’t, then I will come back  tomorrow and wash and wax every car on your showroom floor for free and leave  with no questions asked. Either way you win, Sir. I don’t know kid, this is a pretty strange way to hire someone; in a pizza place of  all ..... . Look Sir, Leo interrupted. You have a problem, you need salespeople to show and  sell cars. Didn’t I hear you correctly before say that you will lose your allotment  and discount unless some cars go down the road today? Do we have a deal or  should I stop wasting our time and start talking to your competition? I need a job  and I need one today! Leo had a moment where he felt a rush of passion, power and assertiveness that he  wasn’t aware he was capable of feeling. He knew he had just made a ‘yes’ or ‘no’  G.U.T.S. move just like Max had shown him. He had to make the deal work fast or  find something else. He held his breath as he watched the brown eyes of a man  named Herman and awaited his decision.  Herman took a deep breath as he began weighing the situation. On one hand, he  had just lost his best salesman, on the other hand, he had this strange kid who  seemed to really want the job. All this weird talk about G.U.T.S., Mentors and  such. Oh well, he figured, what did he have to lose? Business was slow that day  anyway. Ok Bud, I'm a gambling man. You have the rest of the day to sell a car.  You make a sale, you got a job and an advance, but no sale and we owe you nothing and I get my cars washed gratis. He held out his hand, my name is Herman and  I’m the sales manager for Grand Motors here in the city. You have 10 hours before  we close for the day. By the way, what did you say your name was? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 97

The Opportunity Leo went into the showroom and began to read some of the free literature available  for the customers which he found in a standup rack. He also looked over the cars  and read the information and prices which were displayed on the car window sales  sticker. Leo began to realize how foolish he had been to think he could learn the  essentials of automotive engineering, accessories and finance just by reading some  literature. He remembered that Max had said that knowledge was important, but it  wasn’t essential to being a great closer.  He figured that he should observe the other salesmen and see what they do with the  prospects who walk into the showroom. He had noticed that the salesmen seemed  to rush at the prospect, give a firm handshake and then begin talking. They told the  customer all about the merits of the car’s engine or the car’s transmission or the  finance plans. From what Leo could see, most of the salesmen gave presentations,  took the customers on demo drives and a few even got some of the prospects into  their small cubicles to write up an offer. Most offers, however, were rejected and  the salesmen usually grumbled something about the economy or the time wasting  prospects. Leo thought about that for a while, too. Max had also said that he should  consider the source of his information. Maybe watching these fellows wasn’t the  best way to learn! The veteran showroom salespeople and staff looked upon him with curiosity. After  all, he was a new face, but they were used to new faces as the dealership had a  very high turnover of personnel, which was normal for this type of business.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 98

## Page 99

Leo thought about what he learned from Max and how his Mentor would approach  the problem of his car sales ignorance. Max would organize his thoughts and ask  himself “why do people need and eventually buy cars?” Leo continued to think to  himself, “what are the questions I need to ask in order to eliminate quickly or to qualify sufficiently so I can sell the buyer?” The dealership used a system of rotation where the salespeople took turns with the  prospective buyers who walked in. Leo had two opportunities to sell cars. The first  prospect was a young family who had great aspirations of owning a new car, but  upon further examination Leo learned that they had bad credit and no trade-in or  down payment. He rejected them quickly, but politely as Max had taught him. Max  had told him “never to waste his resources on prospects who had a very low likelihood of doing business”. He had advised Leo never to gamble in the Las Vegas casinos because it was a sure thing that the casinos would win and he wouldn’t. “After all”, he had added, “how do you think all of those casinos were built?” Leo had  never thought of it from that perspective before. The next walk-in, as they were referred to, was a college student who wanted  some literature on their newest most expensive sports car convertible. Leo went  into his discovery mode and with a few simple questions he quickly determined  that all the student wanted was a fancy color brochure to hang in his dorm room. Both of the prospects that he spoke with took less than 5 minutes of questioning in  order for Leo to discover that there was no potential for business. Whenever they  asked him a question, he used the redirection techniques that Max had practiced  with him. Leo now knew that sharing information would not result in a sale unless  he had some solid information. Herman’s job as the sales manager was to keep an eye on the sales floor at all times  and he was watching Leo very carefully. I hope I didn’t make a mistake in hiring  that Leo kid, he thought to himself. He watched as another prospect, who was  speaking to Leo left the showroom almost as quickly as he came. That did it! He  rapidly walked over to Leo and asked, why are you losing your prospects so  quickly?  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 99

## Page 100

I’m not losing them Herman, I’m just working smart. No sense spending time,  handing out literature or burning up gas in demo drives with someone who can’t or  won’t buy today..... The rest of his explanation was lost on Herman as he walked  away shaking his head from side to side, already regretting their agreement. Leo took a quick break and went for a cup of coffee in the employee lounge. One  side of the room was all glass so the salesmen could look out onto the showroom  and see who was walking in off the street. Leo heard the salesmen begin to chatter  about a lady who slowly made her way to the front door. Oh no, look Tony, look who is back, your old friend, Mrs. Worthington. Yea, came Tony’s ready reply and she’s looking at the X77 again. I don’t know  about you, but I refuse to waste any more time on her, you take her. No way! The other salesperson replied. Leo spoke up, hey guys, mind if I take her? I need the experience. Go ahead new boy, but she is just a waste of time, a tire kicker. I tried every sales  move in the book the last time she was here. I gave her my best presentation and all  she could say was ‘thank you’ and I’ll think about it. She has been with all of us at one time or another and has never bought a car,  commented yet another salesman. Heck, she came to the dealership using the local bus line. I just saw her get off at  the corner; probably just a lonely old lady, crazy or something. Someone who takes  the bus is never going to buy a 100K ride. Leo was already on the showroom floor and was approaching the woman. She appeared to be in her 70’s and she was well dressed. She had silver hair that was meticulously coiffured. Leo had learned from Max never to assume the worthiness of  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 100

## Page 101

a prospect until you attempted to disqualify them. Excuse me ma’am, but can I  help you or would you rather be left alone?  Yes, I do need some help and thank you, young man for asking. The last time I was  here the salesman started babbling a mile a minute, bored me to tears and then  tried to pressure me to take a ride. Can you tell me something about this car? She  pointed to the most expensive car on the showroom floor, the limited edition 2  seater sports car convertible, the X77 which was painted in flaming red. Leo had heard that no one could sell the car because of its high price. They only  had one model in stock and wouldn’t let it go unless they got their full asking  price. It had been so long on the sales floor that the manager offered a $2500 bonus to the salesman who could sell it, but so far no one had. Realistically, he  didn’t think that he would ever sell this car to the lady, but he still followed the  method as he was taught. Agenda-Qualify-Close or get out when the time was  right. Well, not too much, he answered her question, but I will tell you what I can.  Would you mind if I’m straight forward with you and ask you a couple of questions? That way I can see how I can be of service to you and see if we should do  business together? She tilted her head with a curious look, but nodded in acceptance of his request. It is my understanding that you have been here previously without buying. Is this  car really what you want? It’s very expensive and we have other less costly vehicles that might better fit your needs. I like your directness young man, she replied. Too many of your fellow sales folk  seem to be of the mind that an old lady isn’t capable of buying or even has the need  for such a beautiful car. I can tell you that I am not going to buy a car from anyone  who treats me with disrespect. You won’t have that problem with me Ma’am, but this is a very expensive car. Is  this the right car for you? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 101

## Page 102

What makes you think it’s for me? I just assumed since you were taking the bus that you needed some transportation.  Oh goodness, gracious, no! I just take the bus because I don’t see as well as I used  to and my driver is off today. Excuse me for asking then, just who is this car for, if it isn’t for you? Oh no, forbid the thought that I would get caught in a car like this. It’s for my  granddaughter Judy, of course. I have a perfectly functional car at home. I promised her a nice car for her college graduation gift.  Ma’am have you considered how you would pay or finance this car if you do decide to buy it today? I have a card here from my banker. Just have your finance person give him a call  and all the necessary funds will be made available. She took a business card from  her purse and handed it to Leo. It had the logo of the local branch of a very well  known bank with the president’s name and phone number listed. So tell me young  man, what kind of engine does this car have? I’m not really sure, ma’am. Let’s open the hood and see what’s underneath. With that, Leo opened the hood and looked inside. It appears to be an 8 cylinder ma’am.  They both stood in silence and looked at the state of the art combustion engine.  Why is the engine important to you? It’s not really important at all. It just seemed to be the kind of question I should  ask a salesman. I am a serious woman, young man and I have many questions  about this car. Leo noticed that the other salesmen were watching and snickering at him from behind their cubicles. He could even overhear their loud chatter. Oh boy, is that new  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 102

## Page 103

guy getting the run around from the old lady. Teaches him right for thinking he  could sell someone when the rest of us couldn’t. Who the heck does he think he is? Leo redirected another question to his prospect. Ma’am, why don’t you just tell me  what you think is important and I will do my best to see if we can accommodate  you. Where would you like to begin? I just want to know if this car is reliable and safe transportation for my granddaughter and will you take care of her if anything breaks?  Good point, what else is important to you? If my granddaughter needs the car repaired will you lend her another car? I’ve  heard that reputable car dealers do that. Ok, I can find that out. Anything else? Oh yes, I have many questions. I want the best for my granddaughter. Leo could feel that this lady was very serious about a purchase today and began to  write down all of her questions. He had the feeling that she liked the interest he  was showing by jotting down all of her requests for information. These seem to be  reasonable requests. I don’t know the answers because I just started here, but I will  do my best to make sure everything you have asked is answered. Is that all right  with you?  Leo then remembered what Max had said about redirecting a question with another  question and requesting a commitment, a regular Max G.U.T.S. move. If we can  meet your requirements ma'am, to your satisfaction for the needs of your granddaughter, do you think we can do business today? I would say that is a distinct possibility young man, but I still need to know more  about this car. By the way my name is not Ma’am, it’s Debbie Worthington, but my  friends call me Deb. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 103

## Page 104

It’s a pleasure to be doing business with you, Deb.  Leo knew that he had qualified Deb and had received a minor commitment, but it  was a commitment just the same. He thought for a second if one of the other  salesmen would help him answer some of the questions that Deb had posed, but he  concluded that they would only ruin the situation based on their previous behavior.  Who could help him on such short notice? No one else was available. Herman, the  sales manager, was out to lunch with the owner. Leo pondered that all he had to do  was satisfy the woman's needs and the sale and the $2500 commission would be  his.  He made a decision that if the sales staff would not help, then he would find someone who did know all about the cars, the service manager. He figured that he had  nothing to lose. Leo had never met the service manager, but he noticed his picture  on the wall and knew that his name was Sam. Deb, if you follow me I believe that  there is someone in the back who can assist us. They went into the service department. Hi Sam, my name is Leo. I am a new salesman for Grand Motors and this is my  customer Mrs. Worthington. Could you help us for a few minutes to answer some  questions about the X77. I noticed your picture on the wall and thought with all of  your years of experience you were the expert. I figured no one would know more  about the car than the man who runs the repairs and service department. Sam looked visibly surprised because in his ten years with the dealership, no  salesman had ever escorted a customer to the repair garage to ask him questions in  order to make a sale. As a matter of fact, the salesmen thought that they were better  than Sam and his service mechanics. The salesmen wouldn’t even sit with the guys  from the service department in the company lunchroom. There was a certain  amount of animosity between the sales and service fellows unless, of course,  someone's butt was on the line, then it was all different. He had resented the snobbery, but this fellow, whom he had never met, seemed different. Sure no problem, in fact, it would be a pleasure, he responded. Sam directed Leo  and Deb into his private office which was off the side of the enormous garage.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 104

## Page 105

When they were seated, Leo brought out his writing pad with all of the questions  Deb had asked him. Sam, Mrs. Worthington is very interested in the X77 and feels  that if we can answer her questions concerning the mechanics, serviceability and  safety of the car to her personal satisfaction, she would possibly purchase it for her  granddaughter as a graduation gift. Did I explain that correctly, Deb? Why yes, that’s what I said, came Deb’s reply. If it’s all right with you Sam, I will read you Deb’s questions. Leo knew that it was  a great move to get someone else involved in the sale who was knowledgeable  about such things.  Go ahead, shoot, Sam willingly answered. Leo began to read everything he had written down and Sam seem flattered that his  expertise was needed. He gave a five star performance and answered all of Deb’s  questions. He even took her on a tour of the repair and service facility. He always  made sure the place was clean as a whistle and enjoyed showing off his pride and  joy. Several years ago he mentioned at a management meeting that the service facility should be used as a showplace for potential customers and to close sales. He  told them that other successful dealerships were doing just that and the customers  appreciated knowing that their cars would be in good hands for maintenance and  repairs. The other managers scoffed at his idea and it was never presented to the  owner. The meeting was going fine between the three for almost 45 minutes. Leo knew  that his chances of closing the sale at this point were very high so long as no one  interfered, but that unfortunately was not to be. The other salesmen had noticed that Leo had taken the customer to the repair center which was a big no-no at Grand Motors. Tony took it upon himself to make  sure that Herman knew too, when he returned from lunch with the owner. Hey  Herman, your new boy thinks he can sell cars by taking customers to the service  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 105

## Page 106

department. Maybe he’s teaching senior citizens how to do oil changes and tuneups. He’s giving that time waster old lady the Grand Motors deluxe tour. The sarcasm in his voice was undeniable. The owner looked at Herman. Who’s this new boy that Tony is referring to Herman? I didn’t authorize any new hires and why would he take anyone to the garage? Sales are made in the showroom, not in the back room. Herman excused himself to look into the matter and stomped off in the direction of  the garage. Sam was in the middle of explaining the new generation side and front  airbags on the X77 when the door to his office swung open. There was Herman, the  sales manager, with a less than appealing demeanor about him. Excuse me for interrupting Ma’am, but could I speak with Sam and Leo for just a moment? There  was a forced smile on his face. It was more of an order than a request. Sam and Leo stepped out of the service department office and faced Herman who  was visibly angered. What the hell is going on here? Since when do we bring a  buyer into the back room, Sam?  It was my idea Herman, not Sam’s. Leo defensively responded. Mrs. Worthington  needed just a little information in order to make her decision. I knew the other  salespeople wouldn’t help and I figured Sam here could answer some...... Herman interrupted, well you figured wrong! This was all a mistake. I never  should have hired you in the first..... The door from Sam’s office opened. Mrs.  Worthington stepped out and walked past Herman as if he didn’t exist. I’ll take it,  Leo! Leo and the other two men turned around and faced Deb. Excuse me Deb, what did  you say? Asked an amazed Leo. I said, I’ll take. What do you need, a hearing aid? Please have it ready by the day  after tomorrow. I am a busy woman and a frugal one, but I always keep my word.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 106

## Page 107

You were a gentleman and made sure I got the information I needed to be assured  that this was the right car for my Judy. Sam and Herman stood with their mouths open. Deb walked up to Herman. These are a wonderful salesman and service manager  you have here, Sir. Herman remained silent and just nodded his head. You would be  advised to have all of YOUR OTHER EMPLOYEES treat the customers in the  same manner. You will excuse me gentlemen, but I have to catch the 4:15 bus.  Deb, don’t you want to discuss the price, terms or take a test drive? Leo called out  to her. No, Deb replied over her shoulder, just call my banker to take care of the details.  Oh, by the way young man, are you single? I have a lovely granddaughter I would  like to introduce you to. With that, the door closed and Herman looked at Leo in sheer amazement. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 107

## Page 108

The Changes Leo still couldn’t figure his first sale out. Was it beginner’s luck or was it skill that  had made the sale? All he knew was that he had made his first sale and it netted  him a $2500 bonus, in addition to his commission. Leo was walking 2 feet above  the ground. In all his years working for Excelsior, Ltd. he had never received  money so quickly nor had he felt so good about himself.  Mrs. Worthington was as good as her word and when Leo called the bank, the  president took care of all of the arrangements immediately. The bank president  fawned over Leo like he was Donald Trump who had just dropped in to open a new  account. ‘Why any friend of Mrs. Worthington was a friend of his bank’, he told Leo. If he could be of any further service, Leo shouldn’t hesitate to call him personally. Leo discovered that Mrs. W was one of the bank’s largest depositors. He  also knew that he wasn’t surprised. What did surprise him though, was that she  was such a nice person, not at all pretentious. A courier was dispatched from the bank with a check to give directly to Leo which  he immediately presented to Herman in his sales office. Hey Herman, I think you  owe me some money, as per our previous arrangement. Ok, Ok, kid, I always keep my word. First, I want to ask you one thing. How did  you sell my most expensive car, to a reluctant prospect that none of my experienced  guys could close? You have no car knowledge or experience. It boggles the mind.  How did you do it? All I did was be myself. I learned from my Mentor Max that all you have to do is  not act or sound like a salesman. Become a professional, ask questions and then  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 108

## Page 109

redirect those questions. Take the customer to a place where they do all the work,  give you the information and they ask you for the order because it makes sense, it’s  logical. You have to: 1. discover the customer’s needs 2. determine their ability to pay for those needs  3. decide if they can make commitments to satisfy those needs In just 3 minutes or less you can determine whether you have someone you can do  business with or NOT! No phony schmoozing, no pandering or gimmicks, Herman. Sounds like your mentor guy Max taught you a new way to sell. If it was up to me I  would call it Chutzpah Selling. New Yorkers understand and respect pure unmitigated gaul if you ask.... Sorry to interrupt you Herman, but how about my money? I need to do a little  shopping and get a place to stay for a while. Do you want a check or cash?  Cash Herman, just cash, please. Herman excused himself to go to the accounting department. When he returned,  he handed Leo an envelope which contained crisp $100 bills.  Upon receiving the thick envelope Leo felt something he had never felt before;  pride, accomplishment, self-esteem and real money in his hands that he earned by  his wits and some G.U.T.S. He kept pinching himself, was it all a dream? He  never had this kind of money in his possession. The funny part was all because he  had the G.U.T.S. to tell the truth, act in the best interest of the client, who he qualified, he had made a sale! This was not the sales that he was used to. Would it always be this easy? Would he always be this free, he wondered. He had to find out if  this was just a fluke or did his Mentor really teach him a system, a method of being  financially free doing what he loves for the rest of his life? It was almost a dream  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 109

## Page 110

come true, if only he had someone he could share it with. Leo had no family and  few friends. Who, after all, wanted to be around a broke sad sack all of the time?  There was never any money to ask anyone on a date. Besides why ask, as the girl  would probably say ‘no’ anyway. Who would want to date a poor widget salesman? But that would all change now, he was beginning to understand what Nolan  and Max meant about being in control. He was the big shot, the heavy hitter, he  was in charge because he could provide high ticket sales and he loved it. Max was  right, life is too short for cheap wine and driving a Yugo. Boy, was this a new experience for Mr. Leo J. Silver. He was starting to feel like a winner. He had a fistful  of cash in his pocket and this was truly a new experience. Meanwhile, the other salesmen were furious. They couldn’t figure out how this  new guy who came from the pizza parlor across the street had made the largest sale  in the dealership’s history. He was the mystery man, the stranger who could sell  like there was no tomorrow. Tony, in particular was especially verbal of his dislike  of Leo. This guy is probably related to Herman or the old man, as they referred to  the owner. He comes in here without any previous experience in car sales, doesn’t  even know what engine is in the car or anything. This is pure nepotism or something. Nobody, but nobody sells the X77 only 8 hours after being hired. You guys  don’t know when you’re being had; this is a setup. This guy stole our commission, I  tell you! The other salesmen nodded in agreement. Leo figured that if he was going to survive the next 29 days and defeat The Gauntlet he would have to develop some product knowledge, get some professional looking clothes and a place to live. He decided to give this G.U.T.S. method a real  workout, but before he did anything else, he was going to come to work prepared  tomorrow. Before he left, he grabbed all of the information from the dealership including their colorful brochures and DVDs. Tonight was study night. He knew that  his first day was a lucky break, but tomorrow was another day. He had to prioritize  and build a business plan like Max or Nolan would do. Oh well, he figured, what  would Max or Nolan do? He wondered what their Gauntlet was like. Were they  aware of what he was doing? Were they watching him? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 110

Herman offered Leo a demo car, but Leo figured that a car was not an asset in New  York City. He decided to take a cab which he hailed on the street outside of the  dealership. Immediately a dirty Medallion cab pulled up to the curb. As he  climbed into the back, Leo checked out the name on the license of the driver. Hey  Don, I am new in town and I need a little advice, if you you don’t mind. I need  some dress clothes for my new job. In response Donny said, I drive a lot of my Wall Street passengers to Barneys for  good suits and such, Sir. Would you like to go there? Sounds like a plan, thank you, came Leo’s reply. Leo was still wearing the casual  clothes that he found in the hotel room in Colorado. While they were clean and  casual he felt very self-conscious since all of the other salesmen were wearing ties  and sportsjackets. Donny, do you know the name of a good hotel? Many out of town business people stay at The Plaza Hotel. I should tell you  though, it’s very expensive, but it definitely makes a statement, Donny informed Leo. Thanks for the advice, Donny. It is greatly appreciated, Leo added. He made a  mental note to give an overly generous tip for the time saving information he had  just received. Leo was driven to a very large men's clothing store on exclusive Fifth Avenue. He  was fitted for a conservative, but stylish black 2 button suit with a multiple of  shirts, ties, socks and undergarments. After paying, he was shocked to discover that  he had spent $1440.00! Money went very quickly in New York City, but what  choice did he have if he was going to make it in the next month? He took a second cab to The Plaza Hotel. He remembered Max and Nolan discussing some of the great hotels around the world and Max had mentioned The Plaza  Hotel in New York City. In retrospect, maybe he was giving Leo a clue about  where he wanted him to stay. The doorman in a magnificent red uniform rushed up  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 111

## Page 112

to the cab to open the door and to greet him. Welcome to The Plaza Hotel, Sir. Can  I be of assistance? Why yes, Leo responded, I need a room. Yes Sir, just proceed through the lobby and one of the staff will assist you. Here, let  me take your packages, Sir. I will see that they are taken care of and sent to your  room. Leo made his way through the gold and glass doors into the breathtaking lobby  with its chandeliers, fresh flowers and overstuffed furniture. It was like stepping  into another world. He proceeded to the desk where a young, smiling Asian American woman greeted him. Hello Sir, welcome to The Plaza Hotel. Do you have a  reservation? Uh no, Leo sputtered, but I’ll be in town for a few weeks and I will need a room.  I am sorry Sir, but all of our rooms are currently filled, perhaps if you had called in  advance or had made a reservation. Darn, he thought to himself. Leo figured that before he left, he would give it a  G.U.T.S. try and see what would happen. I’m sorry to hear that. You’re correct, it  is my fault for not thinking ahead. I recalled my Mentor Max said that this is one  of the finest hotels in the world and naturally I figured that while I was in New York  on my Gauntlet, excuse me, I mean business, I would like to stay here. Excuse me Sir, but did you say your “Mentor Max”? Yes, I did. Do you know him? Leo brightened. Please wait here and I will check something out with my manager.  Leo stood by the front desk for less than two minutes when a tall, well dressed  woman approached him and shook his hand firmly. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

Hello Mr. Silver, my name is Kate and I am the front desk manager. Did you say  that you are an acquaintance of Mr. Max and here on a Gauntlet? Yes, I did. Max told me that anytime I come to New York City I should stay at The Plaza, but I understand that you are full up. Yes, we are full, but there is always room for a friend of Mr. Max. I hope you don’t  mind, but I took the liberty of confirming your relationship with Mr. Max’s office  and they confirmed that you are indeed his latest Mentee. I have made the arrangements and you will be staying in Mr. Max’s favorite suite. It comes with a  view of Central Park, full time concierge, meeting room, dining area and completely stocked bar. Will that suffice, Sir? For the second time that day, Leo pinched himself to be sure that he was awake!  Excitedly, Leo thought to himself that maybe a room like that would come in  handy for his car sales. Perhaps he could entertain new prospects or even meet  them in The Plaza. Well sure, how much will this run me? Leo inquired. Normally Max’s special room is $2500 per night, but seeing as how you are here  on a Gauntlet, we will reduce it to $500 per night. Leo quickly did the math in his head, $500 times 30 days would be $15,000! He  felt a little faint at the thought of the tremendous amount of money. His money  was going fast what with the clothing purchased, the taxi cabs and now he was  spending even more money on luxury hotel rooms that he couldn’t afford. Was he  going crazy? The old, Leo Silver couldn’t even afford to pay his $875 a month  rent for his crummy 1 bedroom apartment on time. Here he was acting like a  drunken sailor who just arrived in port after being out to sea for 6 months. Leo began to think how a room in a prestigious hotel like this could come in handy.  What would Max or Nolan do in such a situation he thought to himself? He remembered that Max told him “people make a judgment about you in the first seconds that they see you, you better make sure it’s a good one”. That was the reason  why Leo had spent so much time looking for suits. If clothes make the man, then  Leo rationalized that a suite in The Plaza Hotel was the right address to have for  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 113

his stay in New York. That's it, he decided, I’m either going to do this Gauntlet  right or not at all. You gotta deal Kate, I’ll take it.  Prospecting with G.U.T.S. Leo awoke the next morning in an oversized bed with the softest sheets he had ever  slept on, to a knock on the door. He opened it to a smiling waiter announcing an  enthusiastic ‘good morning’ while pushing a white linen covered service cart into  the room. As the waiter took the cover off the food, Leo eyed a large crystal bowl  which contained freshly sliced strawberries, mangoes, kiwis, pineapple and bananas. In the silver coffee pot was Hawaiian Molokai coffee and next to the pot  were a copy of The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. While he was  being served, Leo noticed a small envelope with the word ‘Mentee’ written on it in  Max’s flowing handwriting. He opened it and read....... Greetings Mentee, You have done well for your first day in the Big Apple, as I knew  you would! The Gauntlet still remains. GET TO WORK! Your Pal,  Max P.S. Try the fruit Salad I sent you for breakfast. You didn’t have to hit Leo over the head with a two by four for him to understand  the message. He donned the new 2 button dark Armani silk suit with the rich royal  blue French shirt and coordinating Dior tie. He put on his new Gucci black loafers  that had a mirror like shine to them. If clothes make the man then Leo felt and  looked like a million bucks even if he was down to his last few thousand dollars.  He was glad he spent the money that he earned in the way he did from the sale of  the X77, but today was a new day and he needed to reach much higher goals if he  was to satisfy Max and Nolan with their grand experiment. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

He was early to work, arriving at 8:00 am and in fact, the janitor had to let him in!  Leo knew that he would have to re-engineer sales techniques in the car business if  he was to succeed. If he did the same thing as the other salesmen he would get the  same results, which were dismal, from what he could surmise. In his observations from the other day, he discovered that all of the salesmen basically stood around waiting for someone to walk in and buy a car. Most of the  business or commissions earned occurred when the dealership had big and splashy  promotions and ads. Generally they just stood around the coffee pot waiting for the  eventual walk-ins. Then they attacked the potential customer like a feeding frenzy  of South American piranhas. In most cases, the prospect who may have had some  interest was scared away or resented the attack of the salesmen or he lied to get out  of the dealership unscathed. The few sales he witnessed were either by luck, referral or a repeat customer. There seemed to be very little creative marketing or  strategies to find new sales. Leo knew that in order to apply G.U.T.S. he needed sufficient prospects to speak  with. The system that was in place was inadequate for his needs. He needed a better way, but what? He knew that Nolan always had more prospects than all of the  other salesmen combined because he went directly to the customer rather than wait  for them to come to him. Leo figured that it should be no different in the car business. He went inside the quietest office he could find way in the back of the dealership. Since no one was there, he decided there would be no problem just letting  himself in, after all, this was a place of business. He pulled out a yellow legal pad  and began scribbling his thoughts: The G.U.T.S. Prospecting Plan A. You cannot wait for customers to appear. You have to create them, find them        or approach them with G.U.T.S. B. Impatience is a virtue, be crazy and unconventional. Do what others are        unwilling to do. C. Sales is the million dollar skill for a person with G.U.T.S.  D. You either win or give up. Either way, there’s no one to blame, but yourself. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 115

Increasing Car Sales Plan A. Find alternative resources of private cars for sale.  B. See if I could get a list of previous customers who purchased or leased cars. C. Network with high end prospects who could buy the higher commission cars. Leo thought that he must find customers who might be likely candidates to purchase or trade-in for a new car. He was determined not to stand around all day and  wait for someone to walk in. He discovered that he could make at least 25 phone  calls a day from resources like newspapers, magazines and the Internet. Leo began  making calls and experimenting as to how to extract or create needs. He found that  the majority of his calls were to answering machines since most people were at  work.  He knew that the best way to make a sale would be to find someone who was tired  of the sales process. He knew from experience when his neighbor would try to sell  the family sedan; showing the car, test drives with unqualified hopeful buyers and  meeting or exposing the children and his wife to strangers at their home. Besides,  who wants strangers showing up at your house, whatever the reason! He figured he  would call on those ‘sell your car’ ads in the newspaper and express an interest in  the car. Then he would let the car owner know that his company would take the car  for a fair price so they could trade their car in for new one. Leo decided to make 25 phone calls, of which he was able to reach eight people.  Of the eight, three had already sold their cars, two were not interested and the other  two made appointments to bring their cars in for a possible trade. Leo made his  phone calls, which at times was tedious, but at least he had something to do and he  was stimulating some appointments for the day. He thought that if he could get a  few sales going and make some commissions, all of the phone work would pay off  and get easier over time. Besides, he did enjoy talking to the people. There was some activity now in Grand Motors as the other salesmen came slouching in as though they had no desire to begin a day’s work of creative sales. As he  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 116

## Page 117

was watching their lackluster demeanor, Leo had a real brainstorm. Why not see if  there was a list of previous customers who he could call and with whom he could  create some new sales. He figured they must be on file or in a computer somewhere in one of the offices. Leo thought that this was a question for Herman and  decided to look for him in his office. Hey Herman, Leo called out to him as he entered his office, how do I get the list of previous customers so I can start making  some prospecting calls? Sorry kid, I like your initiative, but that list is for the old veteran salespeople only  upon request; the other salesboys would kill me if I gave the names to you.  But Herman, as far as I can see, they are just standing around shooting the bull  anyway. Heck, if they don’t want to make money with the leads, give them to me. No can do, Leo. They are already a little perturbed about you making the X77 sale  what with being new and all. I don’t want to rock the boat too much more around  here. It’s bad for moral. Tony gripes all the time as it is! Maybe it’s time to blow up the boat Herman, heck it’s sinking anyway! As for Tony,  I couldn’t care less. I am here to make money and defeat The Gauntlet. Tony should  concentrate on selling cars instead of worrying about what I do! Disgusted, Leo  made an about face and slammed Herman’s door. Herman just shrugged his shoulders and mumbled under his breath, “salesmen,  they’re all alike, just a bunch of prima donnas”. Leo, obviously angered, stomped through the showroom. What is it with sales  managers anyway? I thought they were hired to help the salesmen make sales.  Johnny T. Greed enjoys tormenting people and Herman is worried about appeasing  a bunch of slackers and whiners! What’s the point? Why don’t these guys get it? If  Herman wouldn’t help him, he would find another way to develop a list of prospects.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 117

## Page 118

After a very satisfying lunch, it occurred to Leo how he would be able to get a list  of names. Not only did the service department do maintenance and repairs on the  existing lease, new and used cars, but it also worked on cars from other dealerships. A maintenance report was setup for anyone who had their car serviced and  Sam had the entire data base in his computer. Leo wandered out to the service bay  area and found Sam explaining why a certain part had to be replaced, to a newly  hired mechanic. He was kind and patient and really seemed to enjoy what he was  doing, such a contrast to what he was used to! If he was ever a boss, that’s how he  would treat his employees!  Sam acknowledged him and indicated that he would be right with Leo. They went  into Sam’s office where Leo took the liberty of closing the door behind them. He  told Sam his idea which included doing service calls to check on customer satisfaction and with Sam’s permission, offer a service special. Anything to begin a dialogue with prospective sales customers. Sam had some trepidation about allowing Leo access to the dealership’s proprietary customer list, but this guy was such a go-getter and he was the salesman who  sold the X77 when no one else could. On the other hand, Sam was no dummy.  There would be hell to pay once Herman or the other salesmen found out that he  knew what Leo was doing. After listening to Leo, Sam said to him, you know the  boss is going to go ballistic once he hears about this. Not to worry Sam, no matter what happens, I will take the heat on this if the boss  finds out. It’s my responsibility. All I want is a chance to use some G.U.T.S. Leo, I have been around salesmen long enough to know that there had better be  some reward for the risk. Good point, Sam, Leo laughed. I tell you what, I will cut you in for 10% of anything I sell as a result of the leads you give me. If this idea works as planned you  will also see an increase in your service volume, too. So are we on the same wavelength? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 118

## Page 119

That’s fine with me, but what will you do when Herman finds out and make no  mistake about it, he will find out! By then Sam, it will be too late. I have seen Nolan at my other company break all  the rules and invent some new ones. The bosses don’t care so long as the results  are there. I would never do anything that breaks the law or is immoral. All I want  is a chance to do my Max magic, Ok? Sure kid, I like the way you are shaking things up around here, but be careful. I  hear that some of the sales personnel are not too happy with the new go-getter. By  the way, who is Max? I’ll explain another time. When can we get this started, Sam? How about early tomorrow morning before everyone gets here? You got it, partner.  No sooner had they begun to shake hands when Leo was paged on the intercom to  pick up a phone call. He walked over to one of the house phones. Hello, Leo Silver here, how can I help you? Hi Leo, it’s Debby. Hi Deb.  Leo, can you deliver my granddaughter's car tomorrow evening to my home in  Belvidere? It would be my pleasure, Deb. Good. Leo, make sure you bring an appetite as you will be staying for dinner. My  granddaughter and a few of my personal friends will be in attendance. You and  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 119

## Page 120

Judy will get along famously. I will arrange for your transportation home. Deb went on to give Leo directions to her New Jersey hamlet, which he quickly wrote  down. Oh boy, Leo thought to himself, a blind date. How do I get out of this without offending anyone? Throughout the day, Leo continued to make his calls while the  other salesmen seemed to just kill time taking their “ups” which was car salesmen  talk for walk-in customers. Leo’s two appointments came as planned. The first was a family man whose wife just had twins so they needed a larger car.  Leo qualified him previously on the phone and had a good idea what he was looking for and what he could afford. He chose a family style SUV with all the new  safety features. Leo closed him in a reasonably quick fashion and sent him off to  the finance office. It was a fairly pleasant sales experience. ‘That really wasn’t so  bad’, he thought to himself afterwards. His next appointment was an entirely different story. The man was a real estate salesman for a local franchise and he was 35  minutes late. Hey Bud, sorry I’m so late. It’s not something I usually do to a fellow  salesman, but I just closed a sweetheart of a property deal and the commission  alone is going to pay for my new car! Leo was in awe. Excuse me Mr. Herbert, did you say that your commission would  buy you a new car? That’s my Dad’s name, please call me Bill! Here, have one of my cards.  Leo looked at the attractive photo business card and thought that he needed to get  some of those. Bill interrupted his thoughts. The answer to your question is ‘yes’!  I own a real estate franchise and have been a broker and agent selling and listing  homes for Millennium 21 for the past couple of years. I usually make 3-7% of the  sales price depending on the deal and if I had the listing. You mean that you can really buy a new car with just one deal? Leo was amazed. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 120

## Page 121

You better believe it, Leo. It’s a tough business, but selling cars isn’t exactly flipping burgers either, is it? Leo noticed that a few of the other salesmen, particularly Tony, were making a  poor attempt to eavesdrop on their conversation. He instantly made a decision that  he wanted some privacy from the prying eyes and ears and to learn as much as he  could about real estate from Bill. Max had told him that if he wanted free information, he only needed to find the right salesman. Not exactly Bill, he replied, but  what about the home that you just sold, would you mind telling me about it over  lunch? I’m buying! Do you like pizza? They went across the street, in always busy Times Square, to the same pizzeria  where Leo had met Herman a mere 2 days ago. He looked up at the gigantic  screen advertising a new movie with a well known action hero. Leo ordered the  house special and a couple of Dr. Brown’s Black Cherry sodas. Leo had an insatiable appetite for the delicious pizza and the local beverage from Brooklyn. So  tell me Bill about the deal you were talking about in Grand Motors. I’d be happy to, Leo. The home that I just sold was a small loft in The Village, it  went for 600K! Imagine someone paying that kind of scratch for 650 square feet,  but who am I to judge as long as the money part works. The pizza was served in less than 15 minutes with bubbling cheese topped with  sausage, pepperoni, onions, peppers, garlic and more! Leo asked Bill every question he could think of pertaining to real estate. Leo was amazed at the amount of  money that could be made. He also learned Bill’s needs during the conversation.  It seemed that an active real estate agent had to transport clients all the time. It is  the agent’s responsibility to show homes, go to title and mortgage companies, lawyers’ offices and they are constantly entertaining their clients. They work with  buyers, sellers, other agents and occasionally investors. Bill told Leo that ‘image  was everything’. Leo could hear Max in his head saying ‘voilá, you have a strong  need and you have the money, too’.   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 121

## Page 122

Leo asked Bill if the car that he owned was representative of the image he was trying to portray to his clients. Bill, just a thought, but would a new car enable you to  impress more clients and make more sales? Three hours later they were at the dealership shaking hands and signing papers.  Leo had sold one of their high end luxury cars to Bill, but more importantly he  gleaned a ton of knowledge about real estate in the Big City. One way or the other,  he was going to get involved in real estate. He figured that if he was going to sell  something with G.U.T.S., that it had better be high end and make him a lot of  money! The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 122

## Page 123

The Busy Day The first week had gone by in a flash and Leo had found himself busier than he  ever imagined. He had proven to himself and to Herman that he was no flash in  the pan but a winner, a true top salesman at Grand Motors. The plan he and Sam  worked out with the leads was working better than he had even imagined. Sam gave him the service maintenance records for all of the customers that he  needed. It was a list of car sales, lease customers, used cars, out of town warranty  repairs and local service specials. He especially wanted all cars that were three or  more years old. He figured that these folks would be the most likely candidates for  a trade-in to a new car. Leo had started out calling 20 potential clients, then 30 and  eventually 50 prospects a day. He would be the first salesman into the dealership in  the morning and the last to leave in the evening. He would call the previous service department customers and ask them how their  car was running. He had developed a list of questions which he had written down  and eventually memorized. A typical conversation would sound like this: ‘Hello  Mr. Smith, this is Leo Silver from Grand Motors. Our service manager, Sam asked  me to call you and make sure that everything is operating well with your vehicle  and to your satisfaction. I also wanted to thank you for doing business with us. We  appreciate that you came to us and we want to keep earning your respect and business. Mr. Smith, as a token of our appreciation and as a way to keep you coming  back to Grand Motors, I am authorized to offer you a free oil change, service and  inspection if you can bring your car in this week. Would that work for your schedule?’ The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 123

## Page 124

He would offer a free oil change special which he arranged with Sam. It cost Leo  $25.00 which he paid for out of his own pocket. He figured that he needed to give  something away for free in order to create an incentive for the customer to come  in. The offer, however, was only good for that week and the owner had to come in  personally and ask for Leo in order to receive the gift certificate. Leo would make the appointments, coordinate and confirm the exact time as Max  had taught him. When the customer arrived and specifically asked for Leo, he  would introduce the patron to Sam. Then he would escort the client to one of the  sales offices and provide him with a beverage and some conversation G.U.T.S.  style. Leo would discuss the client’s needs, making it a point not to sound like a  salesman, but more like someone who was interested in the person and his expectations. In fact, he skillfully asked so many questions and went in so many directions, so unexpectedly that the prospect did not feel any pressure. The client was  willing to discuss what he liked or disliked about his car and bring up his own  needs if there were any. Leo knew how people felt about salesmen, particularly car salesmen and he made  it a point not to act or sound even remotely like one. In many cases, the car was not  even discussed and the subject was brought up by the prospect. Leo would deftly  redirect in the opposite direction and the information, needs, money, timeliness and commitment were, in most cases, forthcoming just like the staircase of success. Often, the prospects would not qualify because of low needs, money or credit  constraints. Leo would thank them and then respectfully escort them to the waiting  area, telling them to personally call him if there was anything he could ever do. He  would return to making calls and await the next appointment. He found that with the new method of working with the warm prospects and the  special offer, he could close at least 2 or 3 of the service prospects per day on a  new car for purchase or lease. This covered his expenses for the oil change promotion, Sam’s 10% and provided a sizeable profit for Leo. On Friday of the second  week he set a Grand Motors record and presented Herman with 5 contracts on new  vehicles.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 124

## Page 125

I don’t know what the hell you are doing kid, but just keep doing it, came Herman’s  enthusiastic response. No salesman in the history of the dealership ever sold so many cars in one day. His  prospecting system worked! He just took it in a step-by-step method, just like Max  would have expected. His prospecting and marketing plans were simple: A. Contact and offer free service with some qualification. B. Personally greet and escort upon arrival. C. Qualify further, quickly and politely dismiss or close. D. Send follow up information and ask for referrals for future sales. Leo also knew that if he could free himself from the initial phone calls he could  eliminate a step and be able to set more appointments at the dealership. He wondered who he could ask to telemarket the service prospects. He would have to consider hiring an assistant to free up more time. Meanwhile, the other sales personnel couldn’t believe all of the prospects who  were coming into the dealership looking at cars and asking specifically for Leo.  Tony always seemed to be looking over Leo’s shoulder to see what he was up to.  Leo knew that pretty soon he would have to have a confrontation with him. Tony  wanted to know how the heck this new guy was getting all of the leads. Why were  so many customers coming in everyday asking for Leo Silver? He made it a point  to find out by questioning the next walk-in who asked for Leo. He didn’t have to  wait long for his opportunity. Hi, can you tell me where I can find Leo Silver?  Excuse me, Sir, but would you mind if I asked you how you came to meet Leo Silver? I have never met him, he answered glancing around the showroom. I’m here for the  free gift certificate. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 125

## Page 126

What certificate, Sir? Tony asked incredulously. The one Leo offered me on the phone; the free oil change. Hey, this is on the level,  isn’t it? I came here all the way from Buttzville, New Jersey. Meanwhile, Sam was busier than he had ever been. He was also reaping the benefits of the cooperative agreement with Leo. The service department was booming  with tune-ups, tire sales, bodywork and more with all of the customers that Leo  was bringing in. They would come in for the free oil change and then ask for other  maintenance to be done. Sam wondered why he hadn’t done the same thing a long  time ago. He was glad that he went along with Leo. ‘That guy is a helluva salesman’, he thought to himself. Leo knew that he was making good money for a car salesman. His commission  check for the second week of sales was approaching the high 5 figures. He was  making money, good money, more than he ever did as a widget salesman, but it  still wasn’t enough. He wanted more and he knew that any product or service that  he applied G.U.T.S. to would work. He knew that this was only the beginning and  that every customer, every conversation, every close was an experience that  brought him closer to defeating The Gauntlet. Yes, things were changing for Leo every day; why even his social life had taken a  change for the better. Leo was not exactly a lady’s man. He lacked self-esteem and  tripped over his own tongue when it came to the fairer sex. The night he delivered  the car to Mrs. Worthington’s home was one he would never forget. It was there  that he met Judy.  He had driven to the spacious Belvidere home in the Garden State to deliver the  car. All along the way he was thinking about his recent real estate meeting, he  knew that he didn’t want to sell cars forever and The Gauntlet, as he understood it,  was still undefeated. He had two weeks left, maybe there was some time to try  G.U.T.S. in other ways. His momentary thoughts ended abruptly as he pulled into  the enormous driveway with the newly purchased sports car that he was supposed  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 126

## Page 127

to deliver. A butler opened the door, but Debby almost immediately greeted him.  Debby escorted Leo straight across the room and past the other guests to meet her  granddaughter. Now Judy, this is the young man who I told you about. He has  brought you a little graduation present from your old Grandmother. Leo would you  take my Granddaughter out for a short demonstration drive and get her acquainted  with all the features of the X66? That’s an X77, Deb. Leo corrected her with a smile. Please don’t correct me, as it really doesn’t matter what it is called as long as Judy  likes it and remember, I paid for it! Deb smiled back at Leo. Yes, Ma’am, Leo replied jovially. Oh Grandma, you shouldn’t have. I didn’t need a car like this! As she turned  around to look at Leo, their eyes met. Leo felt like he was going to melt into a puddle of slush. If there was ever a thing  like love at first sight, this was it. She was beautiful, in a natural way. She had  blonde hair sported in a short ponytail and a statuesque figure. There was an uncomfortable silence that surely felt longer than it was. Leo just couldn’t find the  words. ‘Some salesman’ he thought to himself! Finally he blurted out, it...it’s  really a fantastic car miss, let’s take a drive and I’ll show you! He described all the features of the car as she got in behind the wheel. They drove  down the long horseshoe driveway and onto a country lane. After a few minutes  Leo asked Judy to pull to the side of the road so he could take the car’s top down  so they could enjoy the cool nighttime air. After awhile Judy stated with a laugh, you must be quite the salesman to get ol’  Debby to buy a car like this, Leo. Are you always so persuasive? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 127

## Page 128

I did very little actually. Leo replied. All I did was give your Grandmother the attention she deserved and had my friend Sam, the service department manager, answer her questions. She was a pleasure to do business with. Well all the same, you really made an impression on her. Maybe I should be on my  guard, she said coyly. So tell me, do you have any family, are you married or dating anyone? Leo was slightly taken aback by Judy’s directness, but he knew that she must have  gotten it from Debby. She had taken the car up to a higher speed around the country roads. I hope she doesn’t go any faster, Leo thought to himself. No, I’m single  and I‘m out here for a while on business, just visiting from the West Coast. Say are you hungry, Leo? I know this great Portuguese seafood restaurant in Newark.  Sure, but aren’t they expecting us back at the house? They won’t mind, besides this is my favorite restaurant. The cuisine is to die for!  Don’t we need a reservation or something? It is Friday night!  Let’s give it a try anyway. You look like a man who takes chances. You game, Leopold? It had been a long time since anyone had called him by his proper full name. In  fact, the last person to ever call him that was his departed Mother and only when  he was in trouble. They reached the restaurant off of Mc Carter Highway and pulled into a private  parking lot across the street from the restaurant. Leo made sure to tip the attendant  so he would keep a special eye on the new car. Newark was known for it’s high  rate of car thefts and he didn’t want to explain to Deb how they had misplaced the  new car on its first sojourn. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 128

## Page 129

The sign over the restaurant said “The Spain”. They entered through the front door  into a busy bar section of the restaurant. The aroma of garlic was overwhelming,  but wonderful at the same time. It wasn’t too subtle for this old world style eatery.  The place was packed and it didn’t look like there would be a table available for  hours. Judy went up to the maître d and placed her name on a very long list. She  returned to her seat at the bar looking despondent. Maybe you were right Leo.  Darn it, I love this place and I am so hungry, but it’s going to be at least 3 hours  before we get a table. ‘How come this never happens to Max?’ Leo pondered. He would never allow  himself to be in a situation like this. Why do I have to feel so helpless when I want  to impress this beautiful girl. Then he remembered one of Max’s rules: “You can  wait for things to happen or you can make things happen! Impatience is always a  virtue”. Leo excused himself and walked over to the maître d’s podium. In his mind he  could hear Max saying ‘use the Method, it works for everything. Redirect, create a  need and a solution’. Yes sir, the maître d acknowledged Leo with a pompous air. Excuse me, Juan I was wondering if I could have a word with you. You appear to  be working very hard at this restaurant, you must be the owner. I wish! The restaurant is owned by my brother-in-law who is still on vacation  down in the Virgin Islands. I’m sure that he appreciates your hard work and pays you very well. I can see by  the crowd that you have a very successful establishment. We do Ok because I put in 70 hours a week!

Let me ask you for a favor Juan and maybe we can help each other. Juan looked at  Leo with interest. I’m here with a wonderful girl who I’ve just been introduced to,  who loves your place. She was told that the wait may be as long as three hours. I  would like to treat you and your wife to dinner on your next day off. Leo then  reached into his pocket and pulled out two crisp $100.00 bills. Juan looked briefly into his clenched fist and discreetly placed the bills into his  jacket pocket in the blink of an eye. The change in attitude was instantaneous. Your  table will be ready momentarily, Sir. On behalf of my wife and myself, thank you. Leo returned to Judy and took a sip of his drink. A waiter approached them at the  bar a few seconds later and offered to escort them to their waiting table. Several of  the patrons who were also seated at the bar were visibly annoyed that a couple who  had just walked in a few minutes ago were being seated. As they were walking to their table, Judy quietly asked Leo, my goodness Leo, how  on earth did you wrangle a table so quickly? You said you have never been here  before.  It’s just something I learned from my Mentor, came Leo’s confident reply. Sounds like someone special, what’s her name?  She, is a he and yes, I would say that Max is a special person. He is the reason I  am here. He taught me how to have control in my life. I guess you could say he  gave me some G.U.T.S.  Leo Silver, you are a man of mystery. I’ve never met anyone like you. Tell me everything about yourself.  Ok Judy, but.... They were interrupted by a waiter who brought two steaming iron kettles, one contained small shrimp in a savory red sauce and the other kettle was full of littleneck  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

clams soaking in a rich garlicky green sauce. The steam was rising from both of the  large pots. There was a crispy fresh baked loaf of bread on the side and the waiter  told them that in this restaurant dunking the bread was a time honored tradition. A  large pitcher filled with red wine, oranges and apples was also placed on the table.  Leo learned that it was a traditional drink called ‘Sangria’. I hope you don’t mind Leo, but I took the liberty of telling the waiter what to bring.  The food here is utterly marvelous. It’s like being in Lisbon. Wait ‘til you try the  paella. What’s that? I’ve never had it before. It’s yellow saffron rice mixed with a variety of seafood, onions, peppers, garlic and  sausage. You will love it, I promise! Leo moved very close to Judy, looked into her green eyes with intensity, took her  hand and said, I already do!   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

Office Politics Leo had returned to work the next morning a little bit in a trance. He had never met  a girl like Judy and in a way it was a challenge to concentrate on all his appointments. Then there was The Gauntlet. He knew he was doing well for a guy who  was literally dropped off on a street corner. He also knew that he was capable of  so much more. He decided, after his lunch with Bill, that he wanted to get into real estate as fast as  possible. He only had a few days left and he wanted a chance to test his G.U.T.S.  skills in another arena of business, his own business. He found Bill’s card in his  wallet and they set up a meeting at Bill’s real estate office on 72nd Street and  Madison Avenue for later in the day. Leo hated to leave the dealership early, but he  wanted to expand his horizons and the numbers that Bill had shared with him about  New York City real estate really intrigued him. He had to make something happen  that day otherwise he would begin to become complacent like the rest of the  salesmen. Meanwhile, in another part of the dealership a heated conversation was going on. It just ain’t fair Herman. We bust our butts every day and Leo gets all of the prospects. Tony had come into the Manager’s office complaining how unfair it all was.  How could Herman expect Tony and the other salesmen to make sales when the  dealership was giving all the choice leads to Leo.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 132

## Page 133

Herman, the dealership manager, was impressed with Leo’s sales numbers and  dedication to prospecting. There was definite grumbling by the other salesmen  also, but he was willing to ignore the usual salesmen griping as long as the numbers were up. In less than two weeks, the car sales were the best the dealership had  ever seen, but then there was Tony.  Hey Tony, you’re better than that. Leo is just having some beginner’s luck. You  boys could learn a thing or two from him. Did you ever notice that he asks all of  those questions? No way Herman, this is more than luck. Ok then, how does he do it, Tony? I don’t know, but I am sure Sam has something to do with it all. The people are  coming into Grand Motors like crazy for some free maintenance special, but nobody knows anything about it except Sam and Leo. When I asked Sam about it he  blew me off. The boys and I talked it over and we want you to do something about  it Herman. Herman protested that he didn’t have a clue what Tony was talking about, but his  instincts told him differently. He knew that Leo was not the typical salesman; he  had overheard him more than once and his unusual techniques. It was odd that he  rarely gave away any information or brochures. In fact, he seemed to act like anything, but a salesman. He was either asking questions or acting benign. Most of the  time, the prospect either stayed with Leo for an hour in conversation or they got up  and left in 3 minutes. It was very odd the way this Leo fellow worked. Oh well,  whatever, so long as the sales kept coming in. But what about Tony's accusations?  He did have a point and if Herman let it stand he would be complicit in whatever  Leo and Sam were doing. He had better take some ‘CYA’ defense, after all he, too,  was only an employee for Grand Motors. Tell you what Tony, I will look into it and  get back to you. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 133

## Page 134

After Tony left the manager’s office, Herman picked up the phone. Sam, stop by my  office when you get a chance I want to discuss a few things with you. In the meantime, Leo had just closed his first deal of the day and was handing over  the paperwork to the finance manager. He had noticed Tony meeting with Herman  and Sam had called him on the phone and had given him the heads up that the  boom was going to come down soon. This, he figured, because Herman wanted to  see him today before he closed the shop. Leo told him to just tell the truth and not stick his neck out for him. He would take  the heat as he promised. He started thinking about the last couple of weeks and  how he had changed in so many ways. One way was that he had money in his  pocket and he was living in a beautiful hotel, dining in wonderful restaurants. He  was meeting new people; successful, innovative and daring people who worked  hard and were rewarded for it. It was a whole new world that Max had given him  and he was damned if he was ever going to give it up. He realized that he must always maintain this environment of success if he was going to continue to grow and  prosper. He just had to follow Max’s methods of success.  He knew that he just had to do what Max said, “work with the prospects who are more likely to buy and let everyone else spend time with the lower percentage customers.” It was just plain common sense, if you wanted to make more sales you  had to work smarter than everyone else. He noticed how hard and frustrated the  other salesmen were. They wanted success, but they lacked the tools, the methods  and they didn’t seem to even make an effort to change and try new things.  Leo was amazed that with all his success, not one of the other salesmen ever approached him and asked him how he did it. All they had to do was ask him and he  would have been glad to share the G.U.T.S. Method, but they never seemed to have  the slightest interest. The other salesmen were the most knowledgeable salespeople  Leo had ever met, yet they failed to realize that sales was so much more than product awareness and slick presentations. All they had to do was study someone who  was doing well and learn some new skills and methods. Leo concluded that once  again Max was correct; “everyone wants success, but few are willing to pay the  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 134

price of change”. In the end, they either quit the car business or changed dealerships. Their failure was always the fault of others or external circumstances, but  never themselves they would falsely conclude. The thought never occurred to them  to treat their job as though it was their own business. If they were the owners instead of the employees, their attitude and efforts might be different. They were just  presenting and attempting to close while wasting their most valuable resource,  time. They would gripe about the customers with expressions like ‘time wasters’ or  complain that the company didn’t spend enough on marketing or advertising. They  would never consider the fact they were the cause of their own financial failure.  As Max always said, “if you want to discover why you can’t achieve success, just  look in the mirror”. It’s just as Max taught, sales is about understanding human  behavior and developing a dialogue to get the prospect to want to buy, instead of  being sold.  Yes, he had definitely come a long way from a few weeks ago as a widget salesman  for Excelsior, Ltd. Leo remembered a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar that  seemed appropriate for the moment:    “The fault dear Brutus lies, not in the stars, but in ourselves.”   The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

The Real Estate Deal Hello Leo. Come on in and make yourself at home. Leo entered the lavish office in one of the best sections of Manhattan. How’s the  car running, Bill? She’s awesome and it sure has made a difference in my sales. You were right! In  fact, I’m glad you called. I want to give you an order for 5 more for my sales staff.  That’s great Bill, but that’s not why I came to see you. I came here to learn as much  as possible about creative real estate and to get into it quickly. What do I need to  do, take a class, pass an exam, get a license? Whoa, hold on there fellow! It’s not that I don’t respect enthusiasm, but these things  do take time. That’s just it Bill, I don’t have time! Heck, I’ve wasted enough of my life already,  accepting mediocrity as a way of life, but that’s all different now. I only have a few  days left to complete my Gauntlet and more importantly, I have something to prove  to myself. I love it here in New York and I met a fantastic girl. I want to set down  roots and start my own business. Nothing is going to get in my way! Bill, I need  your help. I would like you to be part of what I am going to build. Make no mistake about it though, with you or without you, I am moving forward. Even if I could help you Leo, it would take you several weeks to study for the Board  of Realtors’ exam and take it. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

Bill, I promise you that if you teach me all you know about real estate I will........ Once again Leo, I can’t teach you overnight but, .... well, let me think this over for  a minute. How do I teach a great car salesman how to make money in real estate?  The silence lasted for over a minute while Leo sat impatiently waiting for an answer. I think I might have an answer for you, Leo. It’s a way for you to get into real  estate quickly. It’s been done before by some very successful private investors who  I know and it’s a way you can control good homes quickly and contractually without the need of a real estate license. Ever hear of Lease Purchasing or using options, Leo? Well, I have one person I sold a car to who works on the commodities exchange and we talked a little about what he does. Basically, he controls commodities like  corn, sugar and the like with agreements. He makes money when he buys and sells  for his clients. Is Lease Purchasing anything like that? There are many similarities and I could teach you quickly, especially with your intuitive sales skills. Here’s my offer, Leo. Any deals you bring me either to list or to  sell, I will give you 50% of my commission. Any creative deals you do on your own  that I help you with, I get 20%. Make that last part 10%, Bill and you have a deal. I get to do all the loans? Bill asked. Leo nodded. The men shook hands and an idea was born. The men agreed to meet the next day. Leo stood up very pleased with his negotiations, reached for the door handle and  turned around. Before I forget, those cars that you mentioned earlier, do you have  a color preference? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 137

## Page 138

Bill smiled. He knew he had made a good decision tying his wagon to Leo Silver. Leo, having returned to the dealership, found a large post-it note smack in the middle of his desk which read:  Leo, please come to my ofce as soon as possible. He recognized the scroll as that of Herman’s. Leo walked into Herman’s usually cordial office and instantly felt an uneasiness.  There he saw a scowling Tony sitting beside the dealership manager with a smirk  on his face. Sam was sitting in the corner, rolling his eyes when Leo entered. Leo, thank you for coming in so quickly. Tony has brought to our attention some  issues about the source of your leads. We confirmed all of this with Sam and it appears that both of you have overstepped your bounds. It’s not that I don’t respect  your initiative, but we can’t allow this to go on. Leo and Sam, I am going to have to  ask both of you to resign. Hold on Herman. It’s not Sam’s fault, the whole thing was my idea and is my responsibility.  Look Leo, Herman interrupted, you can’t go around here just doing what you want. Hey Herman, you needed some sales around here and I decided to .... The door suddenly opened and the owner of Grand Motors walked into the office  slamming the door behind him. Everyone present in the room jumped as they  turned their heads to see who was barging into Herman’s office. In his loud boisterous voice he bellowed, Herman, what the hell is going on around here?  Well Sir, I was just discussing the matter with Leo and Sam here and...... The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 138

## Page 139

Well good, whatever you’re doing, keep doing it. I was just going over the monthly  report with accounting. Revenues in sales and service are through the roof. This is  the kind of performance I’ve been looking for around here. I knew something was  different with all the people coming and going. But Sir, Tony sputtered, Sam and Leo here were using the company’s database, offering oil change specials without approval and....... Look Tony, I’m not running a Boy Scout camp. We all get paid around here for  performance, that is to say results. Far as I can see, Leo and Sam came up with  some great unconventional ideas and that took guts. The question I ask myself is  why you didn’t do the same thing? You have been here for years. It seems all you  have time to do is whine and stick your nose where it doesn’t belong. The owner  looked sternly at Tony. Mind your own business and sell some cars! Better yet, find  another job, NOW! Tony slowly shuffled out of the office totally overwhelmed by  what had just occurred. Now Herman, I need to deal with you! Herman sat quietly waiting for the other  shoe to drop and for the owner to give him his walking papers. What a fool he was  to listen to Tony. Herman I have only one thing to say and that is, nice going. You  have really impressed me by taking a chance and hiring Silver and developing  some new marketing for Grand Motors. Sam and Leo looked at each other and then Leo looked at Herman and winked at  him without the owner seeing. Herman understood that this was for taking a  chance on Leo and giving him the job. No further conversation was necessary. The owner approached Leo and Sam and vigorously shook both their hands. Boys,  I like the way you think and act. Sam good for you for almost doubling the service  output and working off of the resources of our existing customers. Leo, how did a  guy with no car sales experience sell so many cars in such a short period of time?  I learned from my Mentor Max all about how to use his G.U.T.S. Method. Are you  interested? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 139

## Page 140

Interested, are you kidding? I would kill to have just a 5% increase in sales in my  other dealerships. What does this G.U.T.S. thing stand for anyway? It stands for Great Unconventional Techniques of Selling. In Leo’s mind, he had  been handed a million dollar idea, so he began to redirect the boss with finesse and  lead him to what he was thinking. He whispered to Sam, now watch this! Sir, I appreciated all of your kind words before, but G.U.T.S. isn’t something you  are interested in, are you? Interested, you bet I am. I brought it up because I own 9 other automotive dealerships. Would you consider teaching this G.U.T.S. stuff to my other places? Leo was almost jumping out of his underwear. Here was the opportunity that he  was waiting for. This was what Max and Nolan were talking about. He knew he  was at a turning point in his life. This was it. The whole enchilada. The Gauntlet.  He had to think quickly on his feet and just go for it because there was no second  chance. The moment was now! Leo, remembered what Max always said, “most  people don’t want anything until they realize that they can’t have it or when other  people desire it. Think about a couple of children playing and one picks up the  other’s toy. Instantly, the neglected toy becomes a source of desire”. Understanding human behavior, their reaction to words and situations was  the key to million dollar sales! Less than a second expired and then Leo spoke. Well to be perfectly straight forward with you Sir, I was considering a career change and giving you notice today.  I am grateful to Grand Motors and the opportunities you......... Leo was quickly interrupted. The owner of Grand Motors was not a man to be denied. Ok, Ok kid, I get it, how much do you want? What's this going to cost me? The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 140

## Page 141

Leo took a deep breath and went for it. ‘Here goes Max, this must be The Gauntlet  you told me about.’ Well Sir, the way I see it, if I do my job right it won’t cost you  anything except a short term investment that will yield you a tremendous return for  very little risk. Before I begin, however, I want a clear understanding up-front, between us. I will make you a proposal and you can accept or refuse it. You have a  need and I have a possible solution. We are here to do business and solve the problem of increasing sales as quickly as possible for the Grand Motors Corporation.  Neither of us has the time to waste, so regardless of whatever occurs between us, a  decision will be reached now. Is that acceptable, Sir? Herman, the owner questioned, are you sure this kid is from California? Sure kid, a  ‘yes’ or a ‘no’. So what’s the deal? Suppose I proposed to you the following: I will spend time with your sales management and conduct one-on-one training classes with the salesmen. I will spend  as much time as necessary at each of the dealerships. I will teach them Max’s  G.U.T.S. Sales Methods with unlimited support not only in person, when necessary, but by phone, fax, e-mail or carrier pigeon. Sam will also accompany me and  teach what he has learned to your service department managers so that sales and  service work together as a team and not as adversaries. You will pay my consulting  firm $50,000.00 up-front for a one year coaching and training contract and 20% of  any net increase in business. One more thing, throw in a new, paid up lease luxury  model for both Sam and me. Make it 10% kid and you have a deal. 10% for the first million dollars in increased business and 20% after that. Do we  have a deal or should Sam and I get out of here and talk to some of your competition? You hear this, Herman? Do you believe the unmitigated gaul, the Chutzpah? You  got some nerve, Leo Silver! Leo thought to himself, ‘oh boy I really blew it, he isn’t going to go for it. I went  too far, but at least I tried. I know Max would be proud’. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 141

## Page 142

Herman, this kid has some stones. Gawd! I love nothing better than a good salesman! You got a deal kid, but you better deliver! Don’t worry sir, you will get what you pay for and a whole lot more. I will have  our discussion drafted and on your desk within the hour. You can make the check  out to ‘Leo Silver Consulting Group’. Are we in agreement? The owner left Herman’s office smiling. This kid was going to make him some serious money he thought to himself. Herman just sat in amazement at what had just  occurred. After he was gone, Leo turned to Herman. Oh, by the way, since this is  my last day as a salesman, here is an order that I received from Bill this morning  for five new luxury cars. I’ll take my commission in large bills, Herman. Now  please! Sure Leo, no problem. Herman knew that the chain of command had just changed.  Leo recalled Nolan telling him that when you’re the top dog in sales you dictate the  terms. Now he realized just what Nolan meant. Leo and Sam left the office and walked silently down the carpeted hallway. They  left the dealership and went across the street to the pizzeria where it all started less  than 30 days ago. Leo ordered a couple of slices and orange drinks and carried  them back to the corner table where Sam was seated. Sam took a giant bite of the  steamy cheese concoction, swallowed and started talking. So Leo, what just happened in Herman’s office?  We have just contracted with Grand Motors and will be earning high six figures  within the next 6 to 12 months. That’s what happened. Leo smiled with complete confidence. Do you want to become an owner in a new company or be an employee  for the rest of your life, Sam? Ok Leo, let’s rock and roll, came Sam’s enthusiastic affirmation. Leo just sat back and smiled. He had faced The Gauntlet and won The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 142

The Epilogue Leo and Sam began to work earnestly on their new sales training business and immediately began teaching G.U.T.S. to the other dealerships’ management and  salesmen. They not only increased car sales by 5%, but within a few months sales  had increased by an unheard of 17%. They further discovered that turnover of  salespeople diminished and the service department was now generating much  greater revenues using Sam and Leo’s direct marketing system. They had such  great results in the training and consulting business that other automotive dealerships within the tristate area were contacting them. They discovered that G.U.T.S.  could be applied to all sorts of product and service sales businesses. They were  generating an amazing monthly income for a couple of guys with a new sales training business.  The only regret Leo had was that he wanted to spend more time with Bill learning  about creative real estate and Lease Purchasing. He knew greater challenges and  income possibilities awaited him and once the Sales Training business was on  automatic pilot, he was going to devote all of his resources to the business of real  estate. He knew that all great wealth was tied to real property. He was a different man  than when Nolan first told him about Max and The Ancient Society of Mentors. All was going well and even his relationship with Judy was moving forward. The  only problem was that time for dating was a greater challenge than before, but Leo  always made time for Judy because they had such fun together. They decided to  take a walk in Central Park after enjoying pizza, Leo’s favorite meal. Holding  hands they took the long winding path past all of the old trees just enjoying the  early summer evening. Joggers, bikers, roller bladers and dogs with frisbees were  all busy with their own activities. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 143

A courier on a bicycle rode up to Leo and Judy and tried to hand Leo a manila envelope with his name on it. Hey bud, you the Leo Man? Who are you? Leo asked him suspiciously.  Just a little ol’ messenger. An old dude named Max gave me a hundred big ones to  give you this. He held out the package. Did you say, Max? Hey, good hearing dude. Here you go, he said as he tossed the package to Leo. Leo opened the package and smiled. Inside were the keys and the title for a new  Cadillac 16 along with the following note: My Dear Leo, You passed The Gauntlet with flying colors and have made  me proud. Your life will never be the same. Remember your promise to mentor another someday. Be well my friend-Good selling!  Max P.S. Nolan says ‘hi’ and you owe him some pizza.  P.P.S. Enjoy the car. It’s parked by the Tavern on the Green  Restaurant. Leo, you look happy, Judy remarked. I am, Judy. Today was graduation day and I just received my diploma. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

Well I can’t give you an expensive car, but let me congratulate you in my own way.  She smiled at him and they moved closer together. Unbeknownst to Leo and Judy, two well dressed men were watching them from a  park bench. A bench that Max was well acquainted with. Max fondly remembered  another Mentee named Ralph. Max and Nolan watched as Leo and Judy were passionately kissing in the middle of Strawberry Fields. They were delighting in just  being with each other and were totally oblivious to all of the passerbys in Central  Park. Nolan looked at Max coyly and asked, Max do you think we should be  watching them?  Why not Nolan? How often do you get to see a happy ending?  The End :-)     The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

The G.U.T.S. Summary Now that you have read my book, I thought it prudent to do a basic review of the  method and its rules. The G.U.T.S. method is designed to train you to work smart, feel great about yourself and become a highly profitable professional person in persuasion. When I use  the word ‘professional’ in sales, I mean it. You are to think of yourself in the same  category as a doctor, lawyer, etc. This method is designed for you to be in control  of the sale at all times and never relegate yourself to a second class citizen or be  subservient to the prospect. We work with the prospects who have a need for our  products and services, the ability to pay and are capable of making a commitment.  All other prospects are quickly and respectfully eliminated by you, the professional. If you learn my method you will have a blank check in front of you for the  rest of your life. You will feel empowered and your self-esteem will go through the  roof. Having said that, however, G.U.T.S. is not for everyone! This is not a touchy feely  or a missionary sales type technique. It involves the ability to change or re-invent  yourself from the traditional, old fashioned and unproductive way people are  taught to sell. I often refer to my method as ‘bottom line’ or ‘Chutzpah’ selling  aka: unmitigated gaul. Many of you will find the necessary changes in learning this new sales behavior  too uncomfortable and will revert to the traditional, original sales techniques of  very little qualification, subservient behavior, constant presentation and annoyingly  asking for orders. For those of you who are willing to change, learn and practice my method, you will  see unbelievable results in a short amount of time. Once again, it is for the person  who is willing to act like a professional, instead of a typical salesperson. The  method is based on keeping control, gaining trust, respect and information up-front  or as we call it, discovery and then commitment(s). The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 146

In many a case, it is you the salesperson, who will decide whether you have a  likely candidate to do business with or to end the conversation. Imagine, you the  salesperson, rejecting the prospect, instead of the other way around. You are going  to utilize a common sense approach with a common sense understanding of human  behavior and its application to persuasion. There are many rules to my method, but first you must memorize the 3 steps of the  Success Staircase:   _/3 Close Step   _/2 Qualify Step  _/1 Agenda Step Each step is then broken down into smaller sections or what I call Baby Steps. The  staircase and its Baby Steps are logically set up and should be memorized and  practiced daily, in order to put you on automatic pilot.  The Baby Steps _/ Permission Questions  for the Agenda _/ The Road Map   _/ The Agenda Step  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

_/commitment  The Baby Steps _/time  for Qualifying _/money  _/ Needs or Greeds  _/ Qualifying Step  The Baby Steps _/CCC (Close, Correction, Confirm)  for the Close _/Satisfy  _/Review   _/ The Close Step Questions allow you to ascend the staircase of success. The means which you use to ascend the staircase are to ask plenty of questions  with finesse and always answer questions with questions or what I call redirections. In some cases, you will utilize opposite redirections. This means that  you answer the question in the opposite direction that a salesperson would normally be expected to answer. This gets the prospect to become more passionate  about his other needs. Through this role reversal, the prospect becomes the salesman, gives his own presentation, overcomes his own stalls and objections and  gives the order to the salesperson. You are not to give away any information or make a presentation until you have  enough information, needs, greeds and commitment. Then you use all of the  aforementioned and apply it to your products/services.  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 148

## Page 149

The Rules of G.U.T.S. Rule: The person asking the questions controls the sales process. The salesperson   must NEVER give up this control to the prospect. Rule: Most salesmen fail because they suffer from premature presentation. Rule: Your product/service knowledge is the only thing you have that is of value            to the prospects, so don’t give it away!  Rule: The best answer you can give is ‘I DON’T KNOW’! Rule: You have three minutes to discover whether you have a potential sale or a             tire kicker. Rule: Ask the G.U.T.S. questions with opposite redirection to get the responses              and passion you need from the prospect. Rule: Use redirection with finesse, feigned ignorance, empathy, imagination and             anything else that works. Make the prospect do all of the work. Rule: If you aren’t hitting the mute button on your phone because you are              laughing so much, then you’re doing something wrong. Rule: The best sales method is stealth. This means that the prospect will never see              the moves that you are making. Rule: Sales must be approached in a systematic step-by-step method rather than              traditional “winging it”. Rule: Understand that sales is a game of chess.

Rule:   Discuss, with the prospect, what is going to happen before it does. Rule:   You need to gain trust, have respect and eliminate traditional buyer/seller              obfuscation. Rule: Sales is the million dollar skill if you are able to harness and understand              human response and behavior combined with some good thespian skills. Rule: Never go to a negotiation unless you are ready to pick up a check or a             contract. Rule: The meek may inherit the earth, but they will never become great salesmen. Rule: If you need a friend, then get a dog! Rule: Life is just too short to drink cheap wine and drive a Yugo.  Rule: Everyone wants success, but few are willing to pay the price. That price is             change. Rule: People don’t want anything until they realize that they can’t have it or that             other people desire it. Rule:   Sales is about understanding human behavior. Rule:   When you’re the top dog in sales, you dictate the terms. The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.

More Rules Sales is a skill that is necessary for everyone who wants to attract success in their  life. You can have the best product, the most capable service, but without organized  sales skills and the ability to make it work, you won't be able to give away 20 dollar bills in Times Square. It really doesn't matter whether you are selling the all inspiring widget or a hamster sitting service, you have to have a method of sales  where you work smart, achieve your financial goals and begin to feel great about  yourself, all of the time. Here are a few more G.U.T.S. rules:  1. Learn to give GOOD PHONE! My nickname is “One Call Close Claude”. Why? Because I get to the bottom line  quickly and respectfully with my prospects. I usually do it all on the telephone and  I use the “Work Smart” Concept.  2. Just the facts, Ma’am. You have the right to ask your potential client all the necessary questions in order  to determine if you have a likely candidate for a sale or if you’re just going through  some time wasting motions.  3. If you need a friend, then get a dog! Sales is not about bonding, rapport or pretentious talks about the weather and  sports. ‘How about those Broncos?’ It’s about making a sale today!  4. Learn how to qualify in the first 3 minutes.  I have a 3 minute egg timer next to my phone to challenge myself with every sales  call. Most sales people waste too much time and energy with time wasters. Qualify  quickly and work with the viable prospects only. GUTS Sales is about working  smart and getting paid today!  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S. Selling Method© 151

5. Sales should be fun and challenging! All of your phones need to have a ‘Mute’ button so your prospects can’t hear you  laughing all of the time. Sales should be fun, challenging, predictable and profitable.   6. Life is too short to drink cheap wine and make cold calls.  I don’t know about you, but cold calls make me very uncomfortable so I change  them into profitable Chaos Calls™.  7. Stop Begging! A pro never has to beg when he can lead the prospect to come to the natural conclusion to buy. 8. But Dr. Freud, I love my Mother! If Sales is a Profession, then you should be treated like a Professional! Ask yourself this question. When you go to your Professional, who asks most of the questions? How can you treat the symptoms if you haven’t discovered the cause?   9. Sales must be organized like an assembly line! Ever wonder why they build cars on an assembly line? It’s because it sure beats  making them one at a time! It’s faster, higher quality control and much more profitable. We need to use modern business concepts in sales, combined with a common  sense understanding of human behavior, a little thespian skill and some G.U.T.S.  Learn the 3 simple sales steps of my Sales Staircase. 10. Get a Sales Mentor. Sales is the world’s highest paid profession, if you treat it like one. Find a teacher  who has achieved the success you wish to emulate and who is willing to be accountable to you. Give me a call, I answer my own phone and let’s talk. (Phone: (970) 726-7979 Web: www.Claude Diamond.com Email: Mentor@mac.com Success in all your Sales Endeavors. Claude “The Mentor” Diamond  The Mentor Teaches The G.U.T.S.
