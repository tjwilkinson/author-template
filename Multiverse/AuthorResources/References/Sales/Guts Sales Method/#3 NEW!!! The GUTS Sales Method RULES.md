The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© My Introduction (This will knock your socks off, but not your Flip-Flops)  A business acquaintance and I recently had the following conversation:  “Hey Claude ! No one wants a book of rules.”  My Response “What if those rules could make you rich, make you truly  happy, give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, empower you with a sense of  confidence you never knew could be possible?  It wouldn’t be worth learning those rules would it?”  “Well yes, I guess, if you put it that way” he said.  “You guess?” I responded. “OK, OK. If your G.U.T.S. guidelines could change my world, my fortunes, then yeah, I  would read it and read it fast.”  He didn’t know it, but I had just used the power and science of the G.U.T.S.  System to Persuade and Influence him to my way of thinking!  I first came upon the idea that sales skills were the missing link, the  million dollar skill after witnessing my own Mentor, Max  “Give Good Phone” on countless occasions and make more money,  a fortune in just one phone call, than I would make in a year. Matter  of fact, he would either close, get a commitment or fire the prospect  in the first phone call, sometimes in just a few minutes. This  seemingly secret ability is not taught in any Ivy League business  Colleges or training seminars. It literally blew me away and knocked  my socks off. (See illustrative picture:-)  Imagine, seeing a truly great salesman pick up a phone and close a  prospect thru his mastery of persuasive skills. To this day, it still  amazes me. How did he do it? That life changing event still moves  me today when I reminisce about Max. We all need to get some  G.U.T.S. and learn these Special Hypnotic Skills if we want the same  results.  G.U.T.S. is the perfect title for my Method or System of Sales. On one  hand, it literally stands for “Great UnOrthodox & UnConventional  Techniques of Sales & Success”.  3

## Page 4

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© I believe that selling for financial gain and personal satisfaction takes  an exorbitant amount of courage or better said, G.U.T.S.  To talk to strangers all day and stay relaxed, have fun and convert  them to a friendly acquaintance, who want to give you money or a  contract in a few minutes, may be a life changing skill worth learning.  These are the Most Important Rules of G.U.T.S. If you’ve read my  other books or have taken my unique One-On-One Mentoring  program, you already know The G.U.T.S. Method and The Staircase  of Success; Agenda-Qualify-Commitment/Close. You know how to  ask questions with Stroking, Nurturing and Empathy. This Rule book  of G.U.T.S. will fine tune that Persuasion and Influence Success  Engine which burns in the hearts of all the great and potentially great  Salespeople.  In many of these rules you will see a unique G.U.T.S. Role-play  outlined. I have been using the role-play method of teaching with my  Mentees for years, but have rarely shared them in written form. The  results of this type of spaced repetition learning and question based  interaction study are astounding.  Finally, Please Remember, Sales is the million dollar skill. You  will inevitably fail if you do not master this combined art and science  of Persuasion and Influence, regardless of all the money you spend  on seminars and educational materials. Yes, all the garbage out  there! (OMG, I feel so much better now!)  Sales is the missing link for most entrepreneurs. It changed my life  and it will change yours for the better, too. As Max my Mentor used  to say,  “Everyone wants to be rich, but few are truly willing to pay the price.”  4

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Person  ALWAYS comes first !!! “We have to believe that we deserve to come first, otherwise we will always be last.” Claude  This is a very controversial rule. Many sales trainers  and motivational speakers get upset with your Uncle  Claude when they hear me say the following:   “The Salesperson Always Comes First!” I may as well get this rule out of the way, up front. I have met so  many well intentioned salespeople who gave the prospect whatever  he asked for, in the hope that there would be some reciprocity; a  purchase, commitment or sale. In most cases, the professional sales  person will be taken advantage of due to their generosity or giving  nature. Yes, the Nice guy does finish last in many cases. In reality, the  amateur Salesperson adapts an unconscious culture of subservience,  thinking that a reward will be forthcoming. The prospect is keenly  aware of this personality type and it is in their nature to fully  capitalize and take advantage of the Salesperson’s relentless giving. Why do Amateur Salespeople behave in this manner, because this is  old school thinking. It’s not that it’s bad, it is just that Old and  Conventional Sales Professionals need to evolve and grow up. In  G.U.T.S., I want the Salesperson to be proud, confident to a fault and  treat the prospect as a patient in need of their professional doctorly  care. We often say that sales is a profession, yet do we truly play that  role with our behavior, words or demeanor with the Prospect?  I think not. When we place ourselves first in the Sales equation, we  receive the following Benefits:  *Compensation for our Time, Knowledge and Energy.  *Respect from the Prospect, standing up for ourselves.  *An Unbelievable feeling of confidence and well being for protecting  our Self Respect/EGO. We now believe it and are even allowed to fire  the prospect. See, I told you this would be controversial and  it’s only the first rule.  7

## Page 8

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© It’s OK to Fire The Prospect I once heard a sales trainer comment to the  audience that all prospects are potential  sales. OMG what BS.  In G.U.T.S., we would rather deal with  reality, rather than waste precious resources  ( t i m e , k n o w l e d g e a n d e n e r g y ) o n  unrewarding, unprofitable and low probability situations.  Claude Note: Please See “Make Money Today Rule”.  Frankly, some people are unlikely prospects in sales for a multitude  of reasons:  * No Money or ability or willingness to finance a sale.  * No Needs or Greeds aka: Motivation. Their score is very low on  the Claude Barometer (See my book “How to Sell with G.U.T.S.”).  * Lack authority to make a commitment.  * Time Frame - not ready to buy immediately or in the future.  * Authority and Maturity to make Immediate Adult decisions.  * Lacking Character to keep a commitment.  Let’s work with the Algorithms that are in our favor, the same as a  Vegas Casino. Ever wonder how they can build those billion dollar  buildings? THEY KNOW that people who gamble will always loose,  on a long term basis. Why spend time in unproductive situations?  Prospects who do not Qualify in your G.U.T.S. Qualification Staircase  are very low probability and a waste of your time.   Role-Play:  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Have you addressed those financial issues so  we can move ahead today?  8

## Page 9

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: Well not exactly, but we are working on  it. Maybe by next year, if I find a job we will have  enough saved and will have a better credit score. G.U.T.S. Salesman: So why did you contact me?  What are you hoping to accomplish today?  Prospect: We have many questions about buying our first home.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I respect that. I have some materials that I  can send you via email that will answer most of your questions.  When you have resolved your financial issues, please feel free to get  back to me.  Prospect: But we still have questions.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I have to go as I have many other  appointments. Have a nice day.   (You’re fired!)  The typical amateur Salesman on the other hand will spend hours of  time in fruitless gratis consultations, Q&As, buy lattes/lunches, waste  gas driving around and answering all the prospects’ questions with no  reasonable chance of receiving a commission or doing a deal. These  types of salespeople are so desperate and have such low self esteem,  they will waste their life with a no win Prospect until they become  mad or frustrated with the prospect.  Such a waste!  9

## Page 10

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© You’re not allowed to think about it Mr. Prospect!  Prospects love to be in control when they know you  are the typical “show and tell, features and benefits boring” type of  salesperson.  They have been dealing with amateur sales people all their lives. They  have heard the same words, scripts and obvious schmoozing all their  lives from car, insurance and real estate salespeople. The prospect’s  objective is to get as much information as they need without any  consequence, commitment or payment. Why should they, when all  they have to say is the popular and evasive “I’ll think about it”!  Claude Note: See 11th Commandment Rule.  The time, knowledge, resources of the salesperson have all been  wasted with almost no chance of ever being compensated. They  would have made more money as a Walmart Greeter!  Let’s look at a typical “Think About it” Objection dialogue.  What they usually say:  Prospect: Well this all sounds good Mr. Salesman, but I need to  think about it for now. Salesperson: That’s fine, I understand. I will send you some  information and get back to you in a few weeks. Thank you for your  time. Here’s my business card.     What they both would REALLY like to say:  Prospect: Thanks for the free information loser. I will use this  great information on comparative pricing, delivery, etc. to beat up  your competition and get a better deal. I hate Salespeople who just  want my money anyway. You all sound the same. I have no  intention of ever doing business with you, but I want to end this  conversation now and give you false hope. 10

## Page 11

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Salesperson: Yes, it was a pleasure to meet you Mr. Prospect and  buy you an expensive lunch, latte, sit in traffic and give up a day in  my G-d Given Life just for the friggin’ pleasure of having you waste  my time. I know you just lied to me and will just avoid all my phone  calls and voice mails. I will shred a business card for you when I get  home instead of giving you one now.  The Naive Salesperson: Oh Boy, This prospect is hot. I will get  him later. Sure glad I did all this important groundwork. What the G.U.T.S. Salesman would say:  Salesperson: Prospect, you are not allowed to think about it.  (Pause and enjoy the puppy dog look on their face.) It sounds to me  that you are more concerned about sparing or hurting my feelings,  than telling me what you really think. When we first spoke, I told  you it was ok to fire me if you didn’t like my product/service.  Prospect: But, I don’t want to fire you!  Claude Note: Finally some Adult TRUTH!  Salesperson: Thank you for saying that. What is the real reason  we are not doing business today? It’s not the cost, is it? Claude Note: 90% of the time, it’s a Money problem!  Prospect: Well to be honest, yes it is.  Salesperson: If Money wasn’t an issue, you wouldn’t want to get  started right away would you? Prospect: Yes, I would, but we really cannot afford the down  payment right now. That’s the truth of the matter. Salesperson: Thank you for sharing that. Suppose there was a  way I could arrange some affordable financing with no interest and  a lower downpayment so we could fix the problem. How would you  feel about that?  Prospect: That would work.  Salesperson: What? Prospect: Yes, let’s go ahead.  Salesperson: You made a wise decision Prospect! Thank you. 11

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Scripts Really Suck!! Apologies in Advance if I offend someone’s tender  sensibilities on what I am going to say next. Let me be  a little blunt here so there is no misinterpretation of  my feelings about pre-written dialogues, supposedly  designed to prepare you for all contingencies in sales.  Here we go, Scripts are BullShit!!! Scripts are the  greatest hindrance to your success because they demean and diminish the  one true skill that can make you free forever.  Claude Note: See my G.U.T.S. definition of success!  You need to be creative, spontaneous, impromptu and improvisational to  get to the highest levels and income in Sales. Yes, this is hard work, but oh boy, is it worth it! I am not against being prepared or rehearsing  certain key passages, stories, quotations, etc., but using the same  repetitive banter is not going to get the prospects EQ (Emotional  Quotient) working. (See The Million Dollar Rule). There is a plethora of  books and endless boring guru seminars with a multitude of mindless  pages of silly, amateurish and senseless scripts for all occasions. A total  and complete waste of money, in my opinion. All scripts will do is make  you nervous because you are memorizing endless variables instead of  learning and applying logic and analyzation. Understand that every sales  situation is unique in some way. It is the height of immaturity and denial  to think you can parrot answers on a consistent basis and have respect  from and control of the prospect. You will just embarrass yourself and not  get the results you deserve. The fact of the matter is that memorizing or  even attempting to learn scripts in sales is fruitless and will distract you  from the essence of persuading the customer. It is essential that you learn  how to think on your feet if you want to be a high earning G.U.T.S.  Salesman. The G.U.T.S. Salesperson doesn’t need a Script because they  practice and embrace the skills of a System. G.U.T.S. is a method of  combining modern behavioral Psychology and having the Thespian or  Acting Skills of an Academy Award Winner. You win when you are  relaxed, confident, spontaneous and the words flow from knowledge,  practice and creating a comfortable environment for all concerned. If  you want Freedom, please throw away the Scripts and get some  G.U.T.S.!  12

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© You Have Rights in The Sales Process (The Salesmen’s Bill of Rights)  It seems that the very act of the contemporary  Salesman is to be subservient to the needs of the  prospect. Basically, give them everything they  ask for without any reciprocity and then thank  them for saying things like:  I’ll Think About it.  Send Me a Contract to look over.  I’ll speak to my spouse.  The Amateur takes this manipulation, lying and rejection without  argument. He learns to accept the rejection as a way of life, just the  cost of doing business. The old fashioned Sales training Gurus still  today espouse the following motivational tripe:  “Knock on a 100 doors and if 100 People Say “no” then knock on  another 100”.  I invented G.U.T.S. because I was sick and tired of being reduced to a  serf. I worked hard to learn real estate, went to workshops and  seminars. I read all the books and listened to all the audio  information I could find. I even went to law school and earned a J.D.  (Juris Doctorate). Yet, for some reason, I was treated by prospects  like I was a long lost relative trying to borrow money! I was the  world’s worst Salesman!  What was I doing wrong, I would ask myself. It was with that self  introspection that I thought it was time that we, Salespeople, had our  own document entitled:  13

That among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit  of Happiness.That to secure these rights they must learn the  Art and Science of G.U.T.S.  Great Untraditional & UnOrthodox Techniques of Sales and Success  So that these wonderful, decent and hardworking  Salespeople shall not perish from the earth.  14

You can have the best product, the most capable  service, but without a sales system and the GUTS to make it work,  you won't be able to give away 20 dollar bills in Times Square. It  really doesn't matter whether you are selling the all inspiring widget  or a hamster sitting service, you have to have a system of sales where  you work smart, achieve your financial goals and begin feeling great  about yourself, all the time.  You have rights in the Sales Process!  A. You have the right to ask the prospect your G.U.T.S. qualifying  questions.  B. You have the right to stop giving away free information without  getting anything in return.  C.

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The GodFather Close Make them an offer they Can’t refuse!  In sales, you are often going to have a situation where  there is no convincing the prospect to make a  decision. You are so close to a sale, but there just isn’t enough EQ (Emotional Quotient) to close the deal.  When this occurs, I employ a technique inspired from the Famous  GodFather Movie. Remember when Don Corleone says:  “Make him an offer he can’t refuse”!  In Sales, it can’t hurt to make a spur of the moment offer with a time  frame.  Claude Note: Always have a backup plan or as they say in Vegas, an  Ace up your sleeve!  Prospect: It sounds great and we could really use that office space,  but we don’t have that kind of money available in the budget right  now. Maybe next year, but thank you for your time. (The prospect  stands up and extends his hand to dismiss the Salesman.)  The Amateur Salesman: I totally understand Mr. Prospect and I really appreciate your time. I will get back to you next year.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s fine Mr. Prospect, but let me ask  you one last question before I leave. If money wasn’t an objection or  issue right now, you wouldn’t want to move forward on the office  space you so desperately need, would you?  17

## Page 18

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: If you put it that way, of course. We have people sharing  office space and it’s really hurting production around here.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: Would you mind if I tried the GodFather  close on you before I leave? I want to make you a very tempting  offer which might be difficult to refuse. Prospect: I’m not going to find animal parts in my bed tonight, am  I? (He asks jokingly!)  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: Let’s imagine, just for a moment that  my company was willing to finance the purchase of the office space  at zero interest for one year. A small downpayment and very  reasonable payments per month, for one year with a balloon for the  balance. That wouldn’t change anything would it? Prospect: That’s a generous offer. Can you really do  that?  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: Suppose I said yes, what  would happen next?  Prospect: I think you have a deal.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: I’m sorry, WHAT did you say?  Prospect: Yes, let’s go ahead. That’s too good a deal to pass up!  The G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you Mr. Prospect, please sign  here.  Hey, I heard that :-)  We do call it G.U.T.S. for a reason;-) 18

## Page 19

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© What do You really Sell Rule?  You Sell Solutions!  A Question I often ask My Mentees during  G.U.T.S. Sales Training is: What do you  really sell?  I get the cute answers like: I sell myself, I sell my company, I sell a  product or a service, etc. Most Salespeople never ask themselves the  most important question: What do they really Sell?  How can we persuade someone if we haven’t reverse engineered what they really want? For example:  A Health Club Center Salesperson might be selling weight loss and  health club memberships during a large advertised promotion, but  have they ever considered why that potential inquiring member is  really there? The prospect is really there perhaps, to increase their  personal attraction, have clothes fit better, maybe due to an  upcoming wedding or family or high school reunion, desiring more  confidence at work to get a promotion or she just wants to feel or  sleep better, etc. The list is long and making premature assumptions  with little inquiry is a waste of valuable time.  Initially during a Sales Conversation very little qualification is  initiated by the amateur Salesperson other than some simple  statements or obvious inquiries. In G.U.T.S. we are looking for  something deeper, the Truth from the prospect. This can only be  drawn out by getting them to relax, like and hopefully, trust us by  utilizing the Agenda, Qualification and Commitment/Close Steps  which are all based on asking questions.  19

## Page 20

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© We have to understand that most prospects buy because they have a  need or greed. They are looking for a solution to or an elimination of  a Problem. They want to remove a discomfort, an agony or increase  an enjoyment. What does a G.U.T.S. Salesman really Sell:  We sell Solutions  We sell removal of Pains, Problems and Irritations  We sell Enjoyment, Comfort and Happiness  We sell a vision of a Better Life, Financial Security, Lifestyle  We sell a Memory  Role-Play at the Cadillac Dealership. A prospect walks in.  Amateur Salesman: Good Morning, Sir! What a beautiful family  you have. How may I help you today?  Prospect: Thank you. We’re just looking around.  Amateur Salesman: If there is anything you need, just ask me.  Prospect: Fine, thank you. We’re just looking.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Excuse me Sir, is that your 2014 Honda Civic  outside?  Prospect: Yes, is anything wrong? Did I park in the wrong place?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: No, it’s fine. I was just wondering why you  are looking at our cars when you have such an obviously well kept  vehicle. You probably only have 25K miles on it.  Prospect: Actually, I have almost 75K on it. I drive a great deal.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Excuse me for asking so many questions, but  what do you do for a living?  Prospect: I sell Real Estate. I am a local Realtor© Broker here in  the area. I am always driving potential clients around.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Not in the Honda, right?  Prospect: Well, that’s kinda why I came in today. The car is too  small and bumpy for some of my clients to sit in comfortably. I  thought it might be time to look around.  20

## Page 21

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© G.U.T.S. Salesman: Why not just go back to the Honda  Dealership? I am sure they could solve your problem and sell you  something larger, more spacious.  Prospect: Well, my son needs a car for college and I thought he  could take my car and I could buy a new one. I’m just looking today.  I’m in no rush. Really!  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for sharing that information with  me. You may want to consider something else.  Prospect: What’s that?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Promise you won’t get mad at me? Prospect: Now I am curious.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Nothing wrong with your Honda. It’s a fine  and safe car, but I believe that it may be costing you many sales.  Prospect: Why’s that?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Prestige. A car for meeting or driving around  clients should make a statement about how successful and  professional you are. While it may cost more, it could result in much  higher sales.  Prospect: I see your point, but no one has ever said anything to me  about it before.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: They have, but not to your face. Most  Prospects don’t want to engage in a confrontational and dead  honest conversation with a salesman until they are in private and  away from him. Please don’t get mad for what I am about to say.  Prospect: Err, OK.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Driving a small economy car could be costing  you commissions, sales and contracts, as well as costing you a great  deal of your selling time.  Prospect: How do you know all this Stuff?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Great Question. Thank you for asking! I deal  with many people in the Sales profession. Their numbers always go  up when they make a better impression to their prospects about  their Success.  21

## Page 22

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: I never thought of it like that. Maybe we should talk  some more.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Let’s go into my office and look at some  numbers. If you like what I have, we can move forward. No  pressure, your decision and you can fire me at anytime. We are just  here to see if I can help you make a much higher income.  Our G.U.T.S. Professional engaged the prospect with an initial line of  questions to obtain information and eventually increase the need and  greeds of his prospect. He knew exactly how and what to sell him.  22

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Be a Story  Telling  Salesman if you  want to WIN  BIG. Our greatest authors, professional motivation speakers, orators and  yes, Salesmen are great story tellers. We all love a good yarn,  especially Prospects. Why, because they evoke a dream, a memory, a  vision in our head. They give us credibility and can substantiate our  strong beliefs about our product and services. They are entertaining  and make us laugh or tear up. For the professional G.U.T.S.  Salesman, stories make the prospect emotional.  Once again, with a good, poignant story we can capture the  prospect’s attention and move him into a hypnotic or trancelike state,  a wonderful controlled environment of positive persuasion. Our  stories should always be ready, at all times to either substantiate a  truth about what we are selling or how it solved a problem or  overcame an objection.  Let’s use a role-play example to demonstrate story telling.  Prospect: Hey Claude, I have been in Sales all my Life. I don’t  really need any more training. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s great to hear Prospect. I appreciate  you sharing your success with me. Question. Would it be safe to say  that you are the top wage earner in your real estate company? Prospect: Well no.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: In your district, state or local office? Prospect: Not yet, but I will be someday.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I have no doubt you are earnest in achieving  your goals.

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© story? It might help you get to your greatness  much sooner.  Prospect: Sure go ahead and tell it to me.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: There once was a turtle by  the river and he was approached by a scorpion  who asked if the turtle could get him across the  river. The Turtle replied “Hey, I’m not stupid. I  know you will sting me with that poisonous tail of yours.” The  Scorpion replies quickly, “Hey, if I did that, then we will both drown.  That doesn’t make much sense Turtle.”  “I see your point and you do make sense. Ok, Hop on my shell and  let’s get going.” The scorpion hops on board and the turtle begins  paddling across the deep river. In the very middle of the waterway  the Scorpion stings the turtle on the neck. As the turtle begins his  entrance into turtle heaven, he turns his head around and says to  the Scorpion, “for goodness sake, WHY?” The Scorpion exclaims,  “Just couldn’t help myself, it must be in my nature.”  Prospect: So what does this story have to do with me?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: It’s in your nature or better said, skill set to  just get by, just make quota, but not to excel. Unless you change  your nature you will never reach your goals. I help Salesmen like  you reach their highest income potential if they are willing to adapt,  learn to change their nature. You don’t have to be a scorpion the  rest of your life. With my help I can teach you the tools to succeed.  Do you want to see change in the next 30 days or are you willing to  wait 30 years? Patience is not always a virtue when it comes to  sales. That’s the point of the story. What should we do next? It’s Ok  to fire me! Prospect: I don’t want to fire you. Tell me how I can get to my sales  goals in the next 30 days. G.U.T.S.

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© My definition of Success Ok, I know this is not so much a rule as it is  a philosophy. After years of Mentoring select entrepreneurial  individuals, I often ask this question: what does  Success look like for you? I usually get responses about the volume of  real estate deals, becoming a millionaire, driving overpriced Italian  sports cars or taking vacations. Occasionally, I hear about relieving a  spouse from a nightmare job, boss or a tiresome commute and having  more time for the family.  My take or G.U.T.S. philosophy is unique in that knowing that the  ability to be able to create wealth by having the skill set and  confidence is so much more important than accumulating assets. For  example, how many people have lost a financial fortune thru a bad  decision, a change in laws, the economy or just plain dumb luck?  My take is that understanding the G.U.T.S. Rules and Sales method  will always allow me to re-create my freedom, my lifestyle. No debt,  top credit score, cash flow, more income than I need with a surplus  for investments, live anywhere I want.  Note: CJ and I live in several lovely places. We never take vacations,  we live them, thanks to G.U.T.S.  I have often exclaimed to my students: Take everything away from  me that I have worked a lifetime for: cash, free and clear real estate,  stocks & bonds, expensive luxury cars. Yes, take it all away, except my  knowledge of the G.U.T.S. Sales method, understanding of human  behavior and my health. Leave me with the clothes on my back (hey, I  don’t want to get arrested for indecent exposure:-).  In 30 days or less, when I get to a phone and begin to use my G.U.T.S.  Success Method, I will be on top again, a 1%er. The moral of this  Rule is that you are free when you are NOT dependent on  materialism, but realize that you could lose it all and bounce back  quickly. Being a winner is a mindset, it’s not based on the  accumulation of assets.  25

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Sales is Scary  Dangerous  and it could be yourKryptonite! “There is no other career choice that can be as personally  rewarding or as profitable as sales”. Claude  I have often heard the statement that sales is the  highest paid profession in the world. What is left out, however, is that  sales also has an enormous failure rate. In actuality, less than 1%  actually make it in sales. By make it, I mean reach a 6, 7 or even 8  figure annual income using the skill set of persuasion and influence.  In this author’s opinion, traditional Salespeople are unwilling to take  the necessary radical chances that success requires. They play it  safe, rather than make what we refer to as “a G.U.T.S. move”.  Well, I have good and bad news for you kids!  Sales is so Dangerous.  By that I mean, it can affect your ego state, your confidence, it can  bring you to your knees and depress you. It can also give a sense of  well being, confidence and more wealth than you ever imagined. You  need massive quantities of Courage to make it in a competitive  world. So should you quit right now? Of course not. You can mitigate  or eliminate the danger by using your words like a surgeon uses a  scalpel. Let’s look at a role-play where the Salesman is in a tight  corner with a tough prospect.  What they usually say:  Prospect: Hey Salesman, send me over your real estate contract to  review. I need it by Monday, 9AM and we will get back to you in the  not too distance future. I am very busy, but thank you for all your  time and information. He then abruptly and rudely stands up letting  the Salesman know the meeting is over.  26

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Claude Note: The Prospect dismisses our salesman and has a total lack of respect for the professional.  Typical Salesman: You are welcome, Mr. Prospect. I  will get you everything you need. Thank you again for  your time.   What they both would REALLY like to say: Amateur Salesman: Oh Damn, Mr. Prospect !!!! I  am going to have to reschedule a family weekend trip, tick off my  wife, break my promise to the kids, spend many hours over the  weekend to accommodate your request on this contract to get it to  you by Monday. Why, because I don’t have the nerve to say no to  you or even attempt to get a commitment or order from you because  I am too scared you might throw me out of the office or give the  order to someone else. Oh man, I really need this sale. Better not  take any chances and do what he says.  Prospect: Thank you, Willy Loman for giving me everything I  want without even asking for anything in return. Now get out of  here so I can eat my anchovy and liverwurst sandwich while I  watch Game of Thrones. Salesmen, Ha!  The Naive Salesperson: What an opportunity the prospect just  gave me. I’m sure my wife and kids will understand cancelling the  family trip to Wally World. Maybe I’ll have a chance to get this deal  and more business from the prospect. Wow, everything is Awesome. What the G.U.T.S. Salesman would say: Prospect: We would like to see some paperwork on this  complicated real estate deal ASAP.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I appreciate your request, Mr. Prospect.  What would you like to see in the paperwork in order for us to  proceed and in what time frame?  Prospect: We would like to see the terms and prices that we  discussed today and I need it no later than Monday next week.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: My only question is what happens when we  speak next week if all of the conditions that we discussed today are  met to your personal satisfaction?  Prospect: We will get back to you and probably proceed.  27

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© G.U.T.S. Salesman: Is that probably Yes or probably No?  Prospect: Well yes, if you can keep to the terms we discussed.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for that excellent input, Mr.  Prospect. It’s a pleasure to work with someone who doesn’t fiddle  fart around and get to the point. We do have a minor problem,  however and I hope this isn’t a deal killer.  Prospect: oh-oh G.U.T.S. Salesman: A contract and modifications of this  magnitude will require me to put in many extra hours, travel time  and discussion with our CEO. I am going to fight like hell to get you  what we discussed, but I will need until Friday. Will that work?  Prospect: Could you get it to me any earlier? I have a board  meeting with my bosses on Thursday and they will hand my butt to  me if I am late.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Is that where you will get final approval?  Prospect: Yup.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: This is gonna be a tough one for me, Phew. I  really want to help you out. (Struggle, Struggle!) I will call in every  favor I can if you promise to give me the signed contract on  Thursday following the board meeting.  Prospect: More than Likely I can do that.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I will burn the Midnight oil because I know how  important this is for your company, but I need something to take back to  my Boss. I know you are a man of your word. Can we definitely move  forward on Thursday or should you fire me now?  Prospect: Wow, you are relentless aren’t you?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Because I am a winner just like you, Mr. Prospect. Is that a YES, BTW?  Prospect: Yes, Yes (laughing) I give up :-)  Claude Note: Our G.U.T.S. Salesman Not only has  the sale, but he was able to buy more time for the  family weekend trip.

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Never go to a  Meeting  (unless you are picking up a check  or a contract.)  Thinking like a Millionaire is easy. All you have to  do is place a greater emphasis on the value of your  time. To a success driven entrepreneur, Time is  their Oxygen. While others are frivolous with their limited 24 hour per  day gift watching forgettable Netflix series, playing online games or Snap  chatting their cat’s bowel movement on their toilet seat (yuck), the  G.U.T.S. Salesman is obedient to the precious Rule of Time - Value.  A G.U.T.S. Salesman will never travel when they know a deal can be  negotiated on the phone or on a video conference call, saving enormous  time so other deals can be consummated or discovered. They will never go  to a property or a business meeting unless they know they will receive  some benefit; information, a contract, a new important relationship or  just pick up a check. You are not a missionary spreading the word on  your fervent beliefs, but a professional, a master in the Art and Science of  Persuasion and Influence. You are a provider, a designator of information  and solutions looking for a significant return on your investment. How  many times has the traditional salesperson gone to an appointment on the  most cursory of inquiries only to discover that there is nothing there for  them. Never go to a meeting unless you are there to make a sale.  Role-Play Prospect: (phone call) We would like to stop renting and purchase a  home. I have many questions and I would like to look at all your  properties that you have advertised for sale. When can you pick me up? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for calling. Before we meet, do you  mind if I ask a few questions on the phone to see if I can assist you? Prospect: Ok, sure.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You told me that you have been renting an  apartment for 10 years. What has stopped you from buying a home?  Prospect: The down payment is an issue and our low credit score.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: How has your financial situation changed? What  would your budget allow you to put down today, as an earnest money  commitment, if we find you the right home to buy?  29

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: We have saved $6500.00 dollars and my credit score will  qualify us for a mortgage in 12 months. We both have good jobs.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I can’t sell you a home until you qualify for a  mortgage and have accumulated at least 10% downpayment, but I may  have a solution. Suppose I was able to put you in a nice home today that  you rent for up to 2 years or more. A Portion of your rent will also go  towards reducing the price. Your $6500.00 will go to the purchase price  as option consideration and you can purchase the home when you are  ready to qualify. I will even introduce you to my mortgage lender who  can advise you and I will waive his consultation fee. How do you feel  about that?  Prospect: That would be a dream come true for us.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Which means?  Prospect: YES! Claude Note: Our G.U.T.S. Salesman has worked smart and didn’t just  rush out to meet an anxious prospect. He placed a value on his Time. You have certain inalienable rights under the Constitution of the United  States. Such is my belief in the art and science of Entrepreneurship. You  have the right to make sure, that before you get into your car and drive for  hours, sit in traffic, expend monies for coffee that you will spill between  your legs when you stop short on the 405, treat unqualified prospects to  exorbitant lunches, dinners, entertainment that you have a reasonable  opportunity and tentative commitment for making a sale.  G.U.T.S. Salespeople must have very high self esteem,  confidence and work smarter than their competition. They need  to get more done in 24 hours then most people do in a week or more. They  are not bullies or intimidators, but they hold themselves in high self  esteem in order to generate a work smart attitude. They receive and give  mutual professional respect and make the money they deserve. The effort  they have invested reaps wonderful rewards from this thing we call life;  with a great sense of pride in themselves because they know they are a  winner.  30

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Opposite George/ Seinfeld Rule  When every instinct you normally have is  wrong, then just do the  opposite to be right.  One of my favorite episodes of the extremely successful show Seinfeld is about George, the unique poor schlub character.  George Castanza: I have no job, no money, I’m bald and I live at  home with my parents. Why should I ever speak to a pretty girl?  Jerry Seinfeld: When every instinct you have is wrong, then the  opposite would have to be right.  George decides to take Jerry’s advice and does the opposite of his  normal inclinations. Success is his when he finds love with a beautiful  blonde in his favorite NYC restaurant and he lands a dream job in  the New York Yankees main office.  I have often thought that modern day sales and marketing is much  like the above story. Why continually do something that has a  constant frustrating failure rate? The only thing that is consistent  with old fashioned, repetitive salesmen behavior is giving  presentations, reading scripts, being submissive and begging/asking  the prospect for an order. These methods do not work, even though,  for some reason they are still taught by well known Gurus.  Ed Note: Yes, it drives me crazy, too.  31

## Page 32

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The definition of insanity, as we have all heard before, is to do the  same thing over and over with the expectation of different results.  Why not go against the conventual wisdom you have been taught and  try something fresh and creative that will engage the prospect in a  stimulating and honest dialogue. Surprise the heck out of them by  your creativeness and originality!  G.U.T.S. is all about being un-orthodox and un-conventional, perhaps  going against everything you were taught.  The premise is that when the prospect hears a fresh approach they  will not use the same old, “think about it line”. They will be  defenseless, you threw them off balance. You will be prepared, but  they will not. Going against the conventional wisdom is never easy,  but if you have ever studied success, you know that innovation is the  ability to see things that others do not.  Be like George, go against the tide and once in a while tell the  prospect:  *They are not allowed to think about it  *Would you please fire me today  *You have a problem and I have a solution  *You are mad at me, tell me what I did wrong so I can apologize  Or go up to that pretty girl and say:  Hi! My name is George, I am unemployed and I live with my parents.  Have the courage to be Un-conventional and Un-orthodox and see  what happens. You might be surprised at the results.  It does take G.U.T.S. to rule the world! 32

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES©  You Are in Business for one reason:  To Make Money  Today !  Because there is no Tomorrow in a G.U.T.S. Sales World  Ask yourself this Question: Why are you in Business? Answer: To make money TODAY!!!  I know, I know all the latest motivational gurus keep saying you need  patience to build a business and to that I say B.S. Too often we push  off the tough G.U.T.S. commitment in order to not appear too  aggressive or impolite. How often have you lost deals, contracts and  upfront profits because you demonstrated patience?  I do not see words and actions such as “assertive” or “aggressive” as  being negative. I highly respect my clients and potential prospects,  yet I also respect my own needs. I respect the value of my time and  the investment I made for my knowledge. I respect that my energy  level is with limits. Bottom line, you have to respect yourself enough  so you place a greater value on your natural resources, you generate  sufficient income and you make money today. You need to get it into  your mind, that in business there is no tomorrow, only NOW. Life is  short, go for it.  Role-Play Prospect: That all sounds great Salesman, but I would like to think  about it for a while.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: With all due respect Prospect, you’re not  allowed to think about it.  Claude Note: Normally there is a pause from the Prospect as this is  a Trademark G.U.T.S. move or a pattern interrupt. They are thrown  33

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© off balance by an impromptu or unexpected statement that they  probably have never heard before in a business conversation. Hey, it’s  called G.U.T.S. for a reason.  Prospect: What do you mean I’m not allowed to think about it? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Prospect, we made an agenda that we would  be honest with each other and you promised to fire me if I couldn’t  provide the correct solution. I feel that you want to think about it  because you don’t want to hurt my feelings.  Prospect: I just need some time to check on my finances.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Earlier you said finances were not an issue,  what has changed?  Prospect: Well, to tell you the truth, I didn’t think it would cost so  much. I really wasn’t prepared to spend that much money.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for sharing that. So let’s pretend  for a moment, that money wasn’t an issue. Could we move forward?  Claude Note: We now move up the yes ladder. Prospect: Yes, absolutely. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Would our Product/Service solve the issues  you have?  Prospect: Definitely.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I can’t change the price, but if I could be  flexible with the financing and make this work for your budget. How  would you feel about that?  Prospect: That changes everything, yes, I want it. Let’s go ahead  with the deal.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you, sign here.  The only way you make money today and everyday is by working  smart, hard and by aggressively taking control of the  environment.  “The meek may inherit the earth, but a Great G.U.T.S.  salesperson goes to the bank everyday.” Claude  34

## Page 35

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© No Begging for the  order or anything Else  Salesmen usually sound like a child asking Mom for another cookie  from the jar. From the first meeting, they are subservient to the  prospect and then wonder why they are treated with such disdain.  “Gee Mr. Prospect, I need this sale to get the National Pickle Award  from my company. I am only one more sale away from winning the  steak knife set.” or  “Please Ms. Prospect, I really need this sale to make this a wonderful  Christmas for my kids”. You don’t want to ruin our holiday do you?  I see this type of behavior all the time. It is humiliating for the  salesman and tells the prospect that you are a pushover and not  worthy of any respect because you have none for yourself. This is  exactly why the Prospect feels justified lying to the Salesperson. I  propose that with the G.U.T.S. Method, we act as a true professional  similar to a Doctor who has a new Patient! They act assertively and  have tacit approval to ask questions and examine you if it will help to  make a diagnosis.  We cannot treat or recommend a course of action without  information. Questions which reveal the practicality of a business  relationship are necessary in order to maintain a degree of respect  and control from the prospect which leads to a professional opinion  from the Salesperson. We must gain the most valuable commodity in  the business relationship, Trust! With trust, getting a commitment is  so much easier, which leads to a blank check and a profitable  business.  35

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© No Presentations unless you have information and a commitment!   “Do you suffer from the Anxiety of Premature Presentations?” Claude  No one woke up this morning and said: Gee, I hope a  Salesperson calls and gives me a brilliant million dollar  presentation on the history of the widget.  The fastest way to lose the attention of a prospect is to go into a  long diatribe of facts and history that they have absolutely no  interest in. More sales are lost because the “old school” amateur  Salesman feels the need to regurgitate everything he knows,  make a presentation on what he thinks is important to the  prospect, without first obtaining any proper qualification.  Interested or Motivated prospects need to be able to convey their  needs and greeds during the qualification step in order for the  G.U.T.S. Salesperson to give a proper presentation at the right  time which results in a sale.  A G.U.T.S. Salesman understands that people react better to their  own needs, not the ones that the Salesman thinks are important.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman needs to ask what their “wants” are and  get them emotionally and rationally involved in the conversation  rather than lecturing them endlessly.  What they usually say:  Prospect: Excuse me Sir, do you sell Dental Floss? Old Fashioned Salesman: Mr. and Mrs. Prospect this is your  lucky day, you have come to the right place. I know everything  about dental floss. Let me tell you about the history of dental floss. I even have a webinar and slide show presentation all prepared. Our  36

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© story begins back in 1819 when Levi Spear Parmly noticed that a  waxed silk thread could procure amazing results..............    What they both REALLY think:  Salesman: Wow! Let me impress them with all my knowledge  about the wonderful world of Dental Floss.  Prospect: OMG, this Salesman is boring me to tears. All I want is a  package of white unwaxed dental floss under $2.00. When is he  going to shut up?  What the G.U.T.S. Salesman would say:  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I would be glad to assist you today. Would  you mind if I ask you a quick question or two so I can direct you to  the right floss?  Prospect: Wow, this guy is interested in what I need. What a  refreshing change from all those other salespeople I always get.  Conclusion: Skip the premature annoying presentation and do  a diagnosis instead. After you have determined the needs/ motivation and affordability of your prospect in a timely fashion,  determined he is the correct authority figure and you have at  least a tentative commitment, then you can give an intelligent  presentation for the close.  37

It's Ok to be rude to a  stranger, in particular, an uninvited guest or a phone call  from a Salesperson and still get into heaven. The initial  perception of Salespeople is dreadful. They are generally  looked upon with disdain or negatively.  I am the only Father, who, upon the birth of his daughter  exclaimed, “Here is my Daughter, the future Salesperson!”  Why, you may ask, would any parent want their child to grow  up to be a Salesman? Most parents never envision or desire  for their children to become a psychological master of Sales,  persuasion and influence, but I did. Why?  I am proud to be a Salesperson. It has given me a wonderful  life of freedom from financial worry and stress. I have  unlimited self esteem and confidence. I fervently believe that  I should be treated with respect for my knowledge and  solution ability. I would have no hesitation in declaring my  children Salespeople rather than a Doctor or Lawyer. For  these reasons I am proud to be called a G.U.T.S. Salesman.  38

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Truth or Lie   Mr. Prospect?  How to control the prospect and maintain your integrity and authority in the Sale.  Something I like to refer to as the G.U.T.S. Move is essentially a  way of getting to an “adult conversation” or better said, “the truth”.  To create a moment of mutual and direct honest dialogue.  Asking the prospect if they want to hear a fable or the truth is a  means of getting them off balance. Making them realize that your  conversation is going to be different, than previous sales discussions.  It places you in control and makes you the authority figure in the  room. This is a means of direct persuasion that can often have an  immediate effect on the prospect in your favor.  Example:  Prospect: I need to sell my home in the next 30 days.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Why is that?  Prospect: We are moving to a new state for a new job and we don’t  want double home payments.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That makes a great deal of sense, Mr.  Prospect and that is a mature and reasonable decision. There is only  one problem. Selling your home in 30 days may be very difficult.  Prospect: Your competition said they could do it. Why can’t you?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Would you like me to lie or tell you the  truth?  Prospect: Well, the truth, of course!  G.U.T.S. Salesman: In the current marketplace for the sales price  you require, it will most likely require a marketing plan of at least  90 days or more. Why do you think the the other salesperson told  you 30 days?  42

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: I’m not sure. I’m not familiar with real estate.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You’re an intelligent man, take a guess. Prospect: They probably wanted the contract on my home,  regardless of the outcome, so they make promises they know they  can’t keep.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Correct. You’re instincts were correct Mr.  Prospect, which is why you didn’t sign with that company in the first  place. Where should we go from here? Was my telling you the the  truth a deal killer or should we get down to work and get this home  sold without lying to each other?  Prospect: I feel like I can trust you. Let’s move forward.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you.  Shocking the prospect with information that may not be viewed as  pleasant or what they want to hear, makes you stand out and actually  increase your credibility and authority. It’s the use of pattern  interrupt. A shocking or unconventional means of communication  that can temporarily throw the prospect off balance.  It is basically an Adult to an Adult conversation, no emotion or ego  states involved. The prospect could be in a child like state (unrealistic  and emotional) and wish for different results. Speaking to the  prospect in an assertive and truthful manner can have the effect of  moving them into a more cognitive state and deal with reality, which  allows you to make the sale.  43

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The Phone  is Not a Cactus How many calls did you make today?  The number one reason why Salespeople fail is simple.  They just don’t speak with enough quality prospects  everyday. That’s it! It’s that simple! Ask yourself this question: How  many prospects did I speak with today?  Claude Note: I don’t care if those prospects are warm, cold or just  old follow ups. You need to develop consistency in your marketing.  The reality of sales is that we do the busy work, but when it comes to  the one thing that will guarantee us a consistent reward, we fail to do  it! What is that one thing you ask? PICKING UP THE PHONE! The G.U.T.S. Method requires a minimum of 5 calls per day, speaking  directly to the prospects to get profitable results. We are all fallible  human beings and we tend to procrastinate about the things that  may not be fun or are hard work, especially if it involves something  we may find unpleasant, just like sales (for some of us).  In order to Succeed in Sales, you need to make use of the greatest tool  for prosperity ever invented, the Cell or Smart Phone. Unfortunately,  a lot of people treat this instrument of unlimited wealth, like it is a  Prickly Cactus.  Claude Note: I am a trail runner. I accidentally hit a cactus in a  California canyon once and it literally took months to lose the deeply  embedded needles. Avoid petting a cactus at all costs;-) Challenge  yourself to understand this rule and make it a part of your daily ritual  or routine. A gauntlet, to speak with just a handful (5) prospects per  day. That’s 25 to 35 calls a week and you will see your sales explode  in 30 days or less.  44

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The Million Dollar Rule  EQ + IQ = Sales Closings. This one rule will change your Life forever! This is probably the one rule of G.U.T.S. that will change the way  you sell. Imagine for a moment, there was one rule that could  make you financially free forever. You would know how to  influence your prospects to make important buying decisions in  an instant. You would be in total control of any sales situation.  You could close prospects on the phone or at the first meeting  and get appointments, confirmations, commitments and  information or get out fast. All you would have to do is learn this  simple rule, understand it, internalize it, practice it everyday,  own it and you will have financial freedom forever. You wouldn’t  want to learn this would You? Of course, you would! Here goes:  “People make Immediate business and sometimes  Social decisions based on their EQ (Emotional  Quotient). They will only justify those decisions  logically at a later time based on their IQ  (Intelligence Quotient.”   Or to say it simply:  People make quick decisions based on Emotion.  If you understand this one essential point, if this is your one  takeaway from my book, than you have gotten your money’s worth! Emotions play a significant part in The G.U.T.S.© methodology.  In the process of using The G.U.T.S. qualification, you have to ask  your questions or converse in such a way that the prospect’s emotions  such as fear, avarice, love, curiosity, security, even anger, surface.  45

Salesman: Mr. Prospect, the exorbitant payments you  are making on your empty rental property hasn’t place any stress  on your family has it? Prospect: To be honest, yes. That’s why we are looking to sell. This  has been a nightmare for us. We are behind a few payments and the  bank is sending some pretty nasty letters to us. My wife is getting  really upset over all of this. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I can only image what that feels like and  what you have been going through. Prospect: It hasn’t been fun, to say the least. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Let me tell you a story. I had a friend in the  same situation as you and the stress it put on his family made him  ill. It took him years to regain his health and financial stability.  If I can come up with a solution that would solve these issues  quickly: (Examples of solutions.)  *get you out of the home so you could have a fresh start  *protect your credit from a foreclosure  *give you a little cash  *remove the stress on your wife  *just get this all behind you in less than 30 days  How would you feel about that?  Prospect: I think I would move forward.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I’m not sure what you mean?  Prospect: I mean yes, let’s do this.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you.  46

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The Prospect has NO Defense against Humor in Sales- so just make them Laugh.  Prospects do business with People who they like!  Laughter is an involuntary response; it’s pretty  darn hard to fake it. Usually when you tell an  amusing story or make fun of yourself (self  deprecating humor) the prospect’s smile or belly  laugh is genuine.  You are in now control. The Prospect’s endorphins are flowing  and they are happy for a moment. When they are smiling you have  created a more conducive environment for Persuasion.  When things go badly in Sales, as they often do, you lose control.  The prospect asks all the questions, the conversation gets negative or  abrasive and you have only one solution to SAVE THE SALE and  that is called humor. Get into the practice of learning how to turn  Chicken Sh*T into Chicken Salad with humor and Sales becomes  a true joy.   Role-Play Examples  Prospect: I’m not interested.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s what my wife said on our Honeymoon! Prospect: I didn't come here to be insulted.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Where do you usually go?  Prospect: Mr. Diamond, I came to your seminar to learn  how to help people and all you talk about is making  money all the time. I got into real estate to help people. 47

How do you maintain an eviction?  (The man in the audience had an heavy foreign  accent and from the back of the room it sounded  like Erection.) G.U.T.S. Salesman: Usually a glass of Wine  and some some soft music works for me, sir.  Prospect: You make me uncomfortable.  G.U.T.S Salesman: Maybe it’s time you  switched to decaf, sir.  Prospect: Do you have a business card or some literature?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: No, but I can throw some out for you when I  get back to the office.  Make them laugh and you will gain one of the most important  objectives in sales “Likability”, which can often lead to Trust. When  you have trust, you will see them lower their defenses, like a  drawbridge. Humor is an underutilized strategy.  Remember, when you make sales fun you make more money. 48

We are having a special on back  surgery this week. Did you see our special coupon in the mail or in  the newspaper?  Patient: Well, err neither. Doctor: You will have to make a decision quickly, Ms. Smith  because the price goes up on Friday. Should I put you down for 8:00  am this Wednesday or would noon work better for you?  Claude Note: Would we ever trust or go back to a professional who  acted like this? Of course not, but this is exactly what amateur  Salespeople sound like!  Too often the Salesperson does all the talking and makes the  following errors:  * Uses an obvious boiler plate Script  * Gives an immediate, unrelated, generic and boring presentation  * Gets little input or information from the prospect to customize  * Acts amateurish and self serving  When you walk into a Doctor’s office you are often asked a series of  questions. There is air of respect for the Doctor’s expertise due to his  title and the patient’s expectations.

Both  parties are working together for a resolution.  There is no battle of egos as there are in most sales  situations. There is a meeting of the minds. The  same could be said for a lawyer or any other  studied professional.  Question: Why can’t we have the same experience in Sales?  The Salesman has to portray his or her self as the competent expert of  their product or service. They have to achieve a level of respect for  their time, knowledge and expertise from the prospect. Think about  how much easier sales would be for you in such an environment. In  G.U.T.S., an assertive and authoritative posture must be maintained  in order to achieve such a trusting role. This is not to bully the  prospect or use obvious trickery, but to make good use of time for all  parties concerned.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman must follow the 3 steps of the Staircase of  Success. (See my book How to Sell with G.U.T.S.). They are the  Agenda-Qualification-Commitment/Close steps and learn how to ask  questions that reveal the ability of the prospect to qualify and the  urgency or motivation to make a reasonable and easy decision. This  will allow for a much more productive meeting for all concerned.  Once again the G.U.T.S. method allows sales to be a rewarding and a  pleasant experience, rather than following the traditional and old  fashioned techniques of persuasion.  Ask yourself this: How many more phone calls would you make if you  found these adult to adult interactions enjoyable?  50

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Stalls and Objections are  Closing  Opportunitie$  A G.U.T.S. Move - “You are not allowed to think about it, Mr. Prospect.” Claude  In traditional sales conversations, the prospect will bring up all types  of negative verbal stalls and objections to avoid a commitment and  perhaps obtain gratuitous information. In G.U.T.S. the opposite  occurs because we see these same obstructions as opportunities to  close, make money, get an appointment or a contract or to get out of a  time wasting situation with prospects who do not qualify.  Let’s look at typical or classic Stalls and Objections by Prospects.  Prospect: I need to think about it.  Amateur Salesman: That’s fine Sir. I will send you some  information and follow up in a few weeks. It was a pleasure to meet  you, drive you around and buy you that steak dinner with that  expensive wine.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: No offense intended, but you’re not allowed to  think about it, sir. When people say that to me they are just being  polite to spare my tender feelings. As I said earlier, it’s ok to fire me.  However, I am here for you now, Sir. How are you going to solve  that problem selling your home? I thought you said it was urgent  and the double mortgage was placing unbelievable stress on the  family. Can we move forward and take care of this today or are we  done here? Your choice. Make a decision or if you like, I will.  51

Thank you for your time.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s a good idea. I will do the same thing  right now.  Claude Note: Our G.U.T.S. Salesman picks up his iPhone and calls  his spouse in front of the Prospect.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Hello Honey. I am here with the Prospect who  is going to check with his spouse to see whether or not he should  make a commitment to buy. I thought I should check with you before  I sell him. Yes, Yes, I understand. Correct, if he buys the house he  will stop wasting tens of thousands of dollars on rent. He will have  appreciation and tax benefits and most importantly, he will have  achieved the American Dream. What do you think, Honey? Ok,  thank you. See you at dinner. He then takes a breath and looks  towards the Prospect with a sheepish grin. My wife said it’s ok for me  to sell you today, but today only.  Prospect (laughing): Ok, OK! You’re a real Smart ass aren’t you?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Nope. Just a G.U.T.S. salesman who wants to  make a point which will change your life for the better. You need this  house and it’s time to make a decision. Call your spouse and let’s  make you part of the American Dream today. Or just fire me right  now.  Prospect: My Partner said yes. But on a personal note, I have to  ask you, are you always like this?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Sure! All it takes is a little G.U.T.S.!  Claude Note: Sorry reader, I am a fanatic about happy endings. 52

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The 75%-25% Rule How to turn the Prospect into the  Salesman and let them make the sale for you! Imagine for a moment, a world where you get the prospect to do all  the work in sales for you. You ask a few simple questions and just  listen and take notes. They do the majority of the talking. They  qualify themselves and share information like money availability and  finance, time frame for purchase, Motivation, Needs & Greeds,  authority to make decisions and character. You sit back and try to  keep from having a Cheshire cat grin and the prospect actually tells  you how to sell them. This is the 75% -25% rule!  I believe with my heart and soul that we work way too hard at sales. I  have always thought that Sales not only has to be profitable upfront,  but also fun. Get the prospect to talk more than we do and watch the  magic happen; the prospect becomes the Salesman!  Typical Sales people always feel they have to give silly upfront  presentations, almost no questioning or qualifications and  pretentious bonding and rapport. They use very old urban legend  techniques that were handed down since Levi Strauss rode the wagon  train and came to California with his pots & pans for the 49ers during  the Gold Rush.  Even today’s modern salespeople believe that high pressure, tricks or  intimidating techniques will overwhelm the prospect into buying. The  truth is that the prospect today has been inundated with marketing.  They are savvy to your techniques, scripts, manipulations and  obvious learned strategies at archaic seminars and sales schools. In  today’s digital society the Prospect is smart enough and has the  Internet to research, handle and evade the average salesperson.  53

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Question: Aren’t we all just a little bit tired of the “I’ll think about  it”, “Call me later”, “Not ready to make a decision” and “Just  looking” responses?  The G.U.T.S. Salesperson has a superior edge because we deal in  reality. We understand today’s prospects, their behavior, their  emotional and psychological triggers. We have a method for working  smarter than our contemporaries and as a result can derive  tremendous profits if we learn how to ask G.U.T.S. style questions.  There is much more, however. We can actually turn the prospect into  the Salesman.  Role-Play  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Ms. Prospect, why are talking today? Why  am I here? Why did you call me? Prospect: I am thinking about buying a home.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s great. There are plenty of homes  available in our marketplace. Shouldn’t you just contact a real  estate agent?  Prospect: We did and we found out we don’t qualify yet.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I am not sure if I understand. Tell me more.  Help me to help you, please.  Prospect: Well we went to an agent and looked at a lot of homes  and then we were sent to a mortgage lender. After filling out an  application we found out that we didn’t have enough credit or  downpayment, but we still want to get into our own home. We have  18K to put down, but we were told we need more. That’s all we have  right now and we can easily afford any reasonable payment. We  really want a home of our own. If you could help us we would be  eternally grateful.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Not really sure if I can help you either. There  is one possible solution. Suppose I could get you into a home today 54

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© that you could buy in the next 36 months with that 18K. How would  you feel about that?  Prospect: We would jump at the chance. We can pay on time. All  we need is about 18 months to qualify.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I’m gonna take a chance on you, too.  Prospect: Thank you.  Let the prospect do all the work without you giving any presentations  upfront and watch your sales grow. 55

## Page 56

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES©  The Claude Barometer You’ll never guess who I named it after!  There has to be a way to measure the Needs & Greeds or  Motivation of the prospect early on in the game,  otherwise you are just wasting good G.U.T.S. productive  selling time.  We actually want to be able to get enough information so  we can politely fire the Prospect or make a decision that you are going to  get a sale. That is why I invented the Claude Barometer©  We give a 1 thru 10 Score to any prospect we are speaking to as follows:  *1 thru 5 = weak low probability Prospect. Not much here to work with.  Very Low or No motivation. Does not have any financial means or very  low interest.  *5 thru 7 = Possibility and may need more work, but motivation is still too  low for a commitment.  *8 thru 10 = Motivated, sincerely interested in your product or service.  These are my barometric guidelines for deciding what rules of G.U.T.S. to  use. What redirection questions do we need to ask? During a  conversation, I will constantly ask myself ‘what is the potential to close  this person?’  Can I accept and enjoy the challenge of attempting to get the 2 or 4 to an  8? What if this person is a 10 early in the conversation and what is the  danger that they will go down to a 1 very quickly when we discuss money?  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, do you mind if we discuss the  money, upfront, for your eventual purchase of my widget? Prospect: Sure, I don’t mind. (He is thinking, ‘because I don’t have any’!)  Take constant measurements of your prospect while qualifying and always  remember to use the previously discussed Million Dollar Rule.  56

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES©  The G.U.T.S. Move Pattern  Interrupts  As I often say and the title of my next book  “Sales is Dangerous”! Some people like to use the words “Psychological Triggers” which are  actions or words which evoke an intended strategic sales response. I  prefer a simpler definition: A verbal shock to the prospect which throws him so off balance that he has no immediate standard  rejection response.  G.U.T.S. utilizes some of the concepts developed by Dr. Eric Berne  and his student Dr. Thomas Harris of their brilliant creation,  Transactional Analysis. They wanted to make psychology simpler so  they could learn from behavior and categorize it into Parent, Adult  and Child States. Transactional Analysis deals with the Ego state of  individuals at different phases of their day.  This occurs by a pattern interrupt. A unique word, phrase, a shocking  statement which takes the prospect out of her comfort zone and gets  her thinking and even into an emotional state.  Examples:  “Mr. Prospect, could you do me a favor and fire me today, rather  than say that you want to think about it?”  “Should I tell you the truth or just lie to you or make up a fairy tale  Mr. Prospect, like everyone else and make you feel better?”  “You’re not allowed to think about it, Ms. Prospect!”  57

Which is?  “Let me ask my Wife and see if it’s OK to sell you.”  “You wouldn’t want to do business today even if I could solve your  problem, would you?”  “Mr. Prospect, you have a Problem. A big Problem!”  “Ms. Prospect, Siri told me to give you a call.”  “Mr. Prospect, excuse me for calling you, but I had to find out why  your beautiful home didn’t sell and is on the expired list. I am  familiar with your neighborhood and could not believe that it didn’t  sell in this market! What happened?”  Ms. Prospect, I have a check for you in front of me. How do you spell  your name so I fill it out correctly, before I send it to you.”  “Mr. Prospect, did you hear what Happened?”  “Ms. Prospect, I need your expertise and opinion on something.”  “Suppose I could give you the (guarantee, references, price) you  have asked for, what would happen next?”  “Mr. Prospect, did you hang up the phone on me or were we just  disconnected?”  Be Different, Sound Differently, be Irreverent and Original!  Put yourself first and watch your confidence soar!  58

They play an essential  key part in Sales, particularly in a cold call.  When my kids were small there was a PBS children’s show that they  loved. It was about a simple man who spoke softly, intelligently and  slowly to the children, on a variety of topics. There was even a little  soft music in the background to set a mood. The warmth of the show  endeared this man to parents. They trusted their kids in front of the  TV screen daily with this nice man. They knew he would never say  anything harmful or disturbing to the kids.  One of the guiding philosophies of The G.U.T.S. Sales Method is that  by correctly using your words, you can gain that same likability and  trust with a total stranger, so well done by Mr. Rogers. Imagine that  by utilizing your practiced Psychological Triggers and Thespian skills,  you could become a “Svengali”, a master of Sales.  Role-Play  Prospect: I need some time to process all the information before I  make a decision. 59

Thank you for all of  your valuable time. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I have also made a decision, Ms. Prospect. I  feel so good about our meeting today that I have decided to make  you a member of my Extended Client Family. You see, my clients  and their needs are my main concern. I want to see you and your  family in a new home in the next 30 days and out of your  inadequate apartment as we discussed. I feel very strongly about  the people I represent. Would you like to be part of my family? I  want to work with you.  Prospect: Oh my goodness, I have never heard anyone put it quite  like that. Sure, I guess it’s alright. Let’s move ahead.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Move ahead?  Prospect: Yes, let’s go for it. I want to work with your company. I  feel good about everything you said.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for your trust. Please sign here.  By injecting a little warmth (Family) into the conversation, the  G.U.T.S. Salesman was able to break down the last bit of resistance or  reluctance by the prospect.  When a prospect delays the decision making process with the usual  stalls and objections, although they sound sincere, they are really  wanting to say NO, but not upset the salesperson. There may also be  a credibility, authority or money issue. The G.U.T.S. Salesperson has  nothing to lose by adding a little bit of Mr. Rogers into the  conversation.  60

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Never Accept a One Sided  Compliment or Criticism  from a Prospect if you  want to Survive with  G.U.T.S.  So much of the relationship between a Successful  Salesman and Prospect is based on Likability, a Meeting of the  minds, which often leads to Trust and a Sale.  In many cases during a business conversation, the Amateur  Salesperson will jeopardize the entire sale by either not listening,  ignoring or not responding correctly to a remark made by the  prospect. The Salesperson will instantly lose a sale and not ever know  the reason why. So much of Sales works in the Sub-conscience of the  brain and to ignore the Art and Science of Persuasion, you are  doomed to fail. It has to be more than just knocking on doors,  reading a script and begging for the order, so much more.  Here are some examples:  Role Play #1  Prospect: Ya know, I really screwed up that last deal I did by not  having a Licensed Realtor© and Attorney help me with the  paperwork and financing. Cost me a bundle. I felt like such a loser.  Amateur Salesman: Oh well, whaddaya going to do? Sh*t  happens, right? Sign here, press hard and you get a copy.  Prospect: Let me think about this.

I wish everyone I helped in real  estate had your maturity and intelligence. If we’re moving too fast,  let me know, but I can assure you I will represent you to the best of  my ability and will personally oversee this deal thru to the end.

I gotta get out of here in the next 30  minutes to beat the traffic. What they’re really thinking:  Prospect: Wow, I slather this Salesman with gratitude and the best  she can say to me is “fine”.

If they say something nice to you,  acknowledge it and sincerely return it. ———————————————————————————————————  Yes, part of G.U.T.S. is recognizing the Psychology, the behavior of  your prospect and responding in such a way that a sincere cultural  connection of commonality develops, which some call ‘rapport’. A  French term meaning a close and harmonious relationship where 2 or  more people understand each other thru honest communication.  Lots of Salespeople regurgitate a bunch of intellectual facts thinking  they will impress or convince a prospect. In G.U.T.S., we understand  that Prospects make decisions immediately based on a passion, an  emotional trigger. They only justify those buying decisions later on  logically. (The G.U.T.S. Million Dollar Rule.)  Never ignore the prospect when receiving a sincere compliment from  them or ignore them when they make a self deprecating remark. It  can be the difference between Defeat and Victory in business!  Claude Note: This is a conversation I remember from a long time  ago, with Max my Mentor. Claude: Max you have changed my life. I feel like I am in control  again both financially and personally. I can’t thank you enough. Max: I am only as good as the student I work with. You listened,  showed up on time and worked your butt off. It is I, who is grateful  to have had the pleasure to teach you and see you succeed! 63

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© S t o p W a s t i n g y o u r  Money on Sense less  Marketing Strategies. Nothing gets me madder than when I hear about money being wasted  on unproductive and often illegal marketing. People spend money,  way too much in fact, on marketing for unprofitable garbage leads.  They use antiquated cold postal and property mail lists and send  unimpressive postcards, letters and texts. These techniques result in  Very Low ROI (return on their Investment).  Others buy blind email lists and start spamming with marketing  letters which desperately need editing and often lead to spammy,  popup webpages. The latest so called “methods” employ Robotic  dialers with a recorded message or texting or use third world Virtual  Assistants. All of these methods, according to the FCC.gov web site,  may be illegal and carry substantial automatic fines.  All of the above marketing methods attempt to get a response or  reaction by capturing your email, phone number or postal address,  without first earning your trust or giving value. Is it any wonder that  people are reluctant to share their personal information anymore?  “Hey Mr. Prospect, Just Trust Me!”  I prefer to utilize more contemporary, practical and legal methods for  my marketing program. These methods result in the following:  * little or no marketing cost  * High Credibility-Earn Trust  * Recognition by the Prospect  * Permission to contact them personally  * No violation of current FCC laws.  * Quality vs Quantity Garbage Leads  64

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© I keep a database of opt-in Prospects only. These are people who have  contacted me and have given me permission to send them  information.  I use the Internet’s Social Media Marketing or as I like to call it  “Virtual Attraction Marketing”. By placing interesting, compelling,  entertaining, contemporary and consistent content in a variety of  applications, I attract exactly the prospect who I am looking for. I  want quality, not quantity.  I personally like Youtube, which is owned by Google and where I have  placed hundreds of short informational videos. These are then  synchronized with the most popular social media pages like  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, Yelp and so many  more. It’s so easy to do and creates wonderful quality leads for my  business everyday.  I get these quality leads directly from the new prospects. They call my  office, leave voice mails, schedule appointments with me online, text  and email me everyday. I contact or followup with these new leads  using the G.U.T.S. Method and using the G.U.T.S. Rule of Five.  I approach my marketing with the attitude that I am a stranger who  offers value on specific topics that relate to my business. I have to  earn the trust and hopefully, loyalty of a new prospect. I stay away  from schlocky commercial style advertising, pop-ups and banners  that you often see on tacky webpages. I just want to offer quality and  content to have new prospects discover the value I can give them and  hopefully gain the right to communicate with them and sell my  products and services. I spend an hour a day tactfully placing my  content throughout social media and spend no money. Be smart in  your marketing, watch your overhead and remember everyone has a  smart phone today! You Need to Stroke, Nurture and be Empathetic.  65

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© People buy from People  they Like & Trust.  The most reliable and consistent psychological  Triggers in G.U.T.S. persuasion style sales is the use of Likability.  Simply said, people buy from people they like; someone they feel a  connection with. I find that once you have likability you can gain trust  and Voilà, you have a blank check with the prospect. You get there by  utilizing 3 amazing triggers of persuasion: Strokes, Nurturing and  Empathy. All three have to be delicately intertwined into your  questions, responses, actions and understanding of the prospect like  the following examples:  Stroke: A Sincere Thespian style compliment that does NOT appear  to the prospect to be pandering, patronizing or condescending. The  operative word is well timed Sincerity.  Roleplays:  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You must have spent a fortune on decorating  this modern office.  Prospect: Actually, I did it myself. I studied Feng Shui at Stockton  State College.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: It really shows, Ms. Prospect, I can only  imagine the hard work you put into this exquisite office. The number  of hours which must have gone into its construction. Beautiful. I  think we should raise the listing price on something as unique as  this. What are your thoughts?  Nurturing: Helping another to prosper and grow with guidance and  caring. Utilizing the skill set of G.U.T.S. word smithing with  emotional stories, metaphors and affirmative statements that end in  a question. Creating a bond with the Prospect, an affinity.  Prospect: This is my Mom’s home and I am helping her sell it. 66 Newman, World’s Greatest Dog

I have made a decision and I  would like to work with you. How do you feel about that?  ——————————————————————————————————— Prospect: We need a real home with a grass lawn.  G.U.T.S.

That isn’t  what you mean, is it?  Prospect: That’s exactly what I mean!  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I may have just such a place for you. Let’s get  to work and create a memory for your family that will last a  lifetime. Are you comfortable with that? It’s Ok to say “no” to me.  Please sign here.  ——————————————————————————————————— G.U.T.S. Salesman Sees an attractive lady in line at Starbucks:  G.U.T.S.

Mentoring Program I often give  my students a simple Gauntlet (like the above) to condition them on  starting impromptu conversations. Beginning a conversation with a  total stranger in a public venue is a skill worth developing in  mastering the art and science of Persuasion.  Empathy: The ability to understand and anticipate the feelings of  your prospect. Utilizing the million dollar rule and EQ (Emotional  Quotient) to prepare a strategy in advance. It is almost as though they  are able to read the mind of your prospect and devise a plan of action.  The G.U.T.S. Salesman has enough confidence, tools and grass roots  experience to reverse engineer the mind set of the prospect. They  have a strategy to deal with the expected reactions to the situation.  They create something special because they are prepared. They know  how the prospect will react, how they feel and they are ready with  their G.U.T.S. toolkit.  Prospect: I need to think about it. Everything you said makes  sense, but I don’t like to rush into these things.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You know, Mr. Prospect, you’re not allowed  to think about it. (Pattern Interrupt with a dramatic 5 second pause.)  Let’s just say that I am fired, at this point.  Prospect: Wait a moment, I didn’t say no, I just want a little time  to digest all this. This is a major financial decision for me. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I understand, but I am not here to sell or  pressure you. You came to me with a problem, correct?  Prospect: Yes.  Claude Note: The G.U.T.S. Salesman has anticipated this response  (“I’ll think about it stall) which is usually based on fear relating to  finance issues. He has to deal with it directly and assertively while  blending in the stroke and nurture statements. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Remember early in our conversation  (Agenda) I told you that I am here to help you solve your problem  68

You were sick of being cramped in a small one  bedroom with your 6 pet gerbils, the rent was ridiculous, the schools  in the area were horrible and the neighborhood was going to shit.  Your words, not mine. Correct?  Prospect: Yes, but I’m feeling a lot of Pressure right now. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Me too, I also feel some pressure. I know how  important this decision is for you and your family. You like the  house, we know you can qualify for the mortgage, the payments are  reasonable and yes, this is a life changing decision and there is a  great deal of pressure. Can I tell you the truth or should I spin a  yarn to make you happy and then leave you alone?  Prospect: The truth, of course.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I know you are scared, but if you were my  brother, I would say the same thing, that I am going to say to you  right now. Time to buck up, show a little courage and take care of  your family. Stop living a life of mediocrity and regrets. You need  this home and every ounce of my being tells me that this will be the  best decision of your life. So it’s time to decide. Do you want the  home or will you lose it in this competitive market? What would you  like to do?  NOTHING IS WORSE THAN A LIFE OF REGRETS!  Prospect: Let’s do it, life is short.

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© The Rule of Five You need to speak with at least 5 prospects a day  No More Stop & Go Marketing  Here is one of the simplest and one of the most important G.U.T.S.  Rules: Consistency in your direct Marketing.  G.U.T.S. is based on learning the true lost art and science of  Direct Communication with the prospect. In order to have the  financial freedom we all desire, you must overcome all  reluctance, hesitation and fears about directly engaging  prospects.  You need to speak with at least 5 prospects a day if you want  your Sales to gain momentum and as a result, to prosper.  Claude Note: This is based on my experience in several businesses.  These include Fortune 500 Chain Food Sales, large automotive tool  Sales, Private residential Real Estate Investing, Coaching, Consulting  and Mentoring. These numbers may be different, depending on the  type of business you are involved in.  The prospect can be categorized into 3 distinct areas; Cold, Warm  and Followup. You will need to develop a marketing plan so you  always have access to sufficient leads and sources. You want to be  busy and challenge yourself to reach your goal of five.  Let’s break the categories down by using real estate as an example.  Cold Leads: These are leads generally derived from publicly  available information. They are houses for sale and for rent by  owners and realtors. Essentially they are signs, classified ads in print  or online media on specialty Websites. This could include Craigs List,  70

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, local and National Newspapers (I  check the WSJ for high end property all the time), Ebay,  MLS (Multiple Listing System) both Private and  Proprietary, but easily available. As well as signs, while driving  around high density condo developments in good neighborhoods,  looking for advertised properties.  Warm (Virtual Attraction) Leads: These are leads that are  generated by the G.U.T.S. Virtual Attraction System. We use social  media to attract buyers, sellers and investors using interesting  content to attract our prospects. In other words, we bring them to us.  It is created in video, audio, written in articles, pictures and live  streaming. Social media includes, YouTube, Google, Facebook,  Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, LinkedIn and so many more.  The prospects can contact you directly through your email, texting,  phone calls or an online scheduling system. (For example see  www.claudediamond.com). Many prospects, after enjoying our  entertaining and informative content, seek further information and  then go to our webpage and register their contact information. Trust  has been created. Follow-Up Leads: Any lead(s) that result in a reasonable  conversation with a prospect and you have determined (with G.U.T.S.  Qualification) that there is a potential to do profitable business either  today or in the future, should be saved and followed up depending on  their Score. (See Claude Barometer.)  Stop and go marketing is a sure way to fail. In business, the more  prospects you connect with, the greater your chance of Success. In the  beginning of your business, shoot for at least 5 Direct contacts a day  using the G.U.T.S. 3 Step Staircase Method.  Consistency is the key on your road to sales success.  71

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© I have made a  decision, Mr. Prospect. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I have made a decision, Mr. Prospect, an  important decision. I have decided that I want to work with you  based on our positive conversation. I believe we would be a good fit  for the business we discussed today. How do you feel about that?  Would you like to move forward or just fire me right now?  This is a Pure G.U.T.S. move. A Psychological statement which boldly  shows your control and authority. This says to the prospect, you are  part of the decision making process, not a submissive Beggar.  As you probably know from previous reading, G.U.T.S. is not a “hug a  tree, you and me” type Sales method. As far as I know, this is the  only system in the world that teaches the Salesman to have GUTS, be  assertive, Study the prospect, ask questions, get them emotionally  involved in an honest adult to adult dialogue. To actually and  consistently use psychology, persuasion, influence and practice  authority without being a bully or intimidating the prospect. I just  believe that “The Salesman comes First” in business and that you  have rights in the Sales Process. By assertively stating that you have  made a decision in the negotiation process, you have made yourself  the Protagonist, the leader, the decision maker. This one move forces  the prospect to accept, reject or re-negotiate your offer and eliminates  the usual time wasting motions by many a prospect, if you allow it.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mrs. Prospect, I would like to make you an  offer today. It’s ok to fire me and reject my offer, but it will expire  this evening by 6PM. It is very unlikely I will make this offer again.  As I said earlier, I have made a decision which I believe is in both  our best interests. What are your thoughts on my proposal?  72

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES©  Can you Qualify  the Prospect in   3 minutes or less?  The G.U.T.S. Challenge  One of the best ideas we thought of, in terms of Marketing was the  G.U.T.S. 3 minute challenge. It is based on the premise that we spend  way too much time in unproductive situations with prospects who  never had the intention or the ability to do business with us. As I have  often said in this book “the Salesperson has rights in the Sales  Process”. Ask yourself: How many brilliant Million Dollar  presentations have you given that resulted in the prospect saying  something like “Gee, Mr. Salesman, I love your product/service and  if I had the money I would buy it in a heartbeat?”  We need to qualify better and ask the tough questions, up front, if we  are ever going to work smarter than our competition. Yes, even in 3  minutes or less sometimes we can determine whether we are going to  make money or waste time.  Prospect: I am interested in becoming a homeowner.  Amateur Salesman: That’s great Prospect, let me show you all the  beautiful homes we have available. Hop into my car, let’s drive  around, look at all of them and I’ll even buy you a Jamba Juice. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for contacting me. I assume this is  your first home? If so, why did you wait so long? Mind if we discuss  money and qualification?  Prospect: Well, I had some financial problems from my  bankruptcy and divorce last year because I was laid off from my job  at the Dental Floss factory.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Let’s do this. I have a mortgage broker friend  you should speak to first and if he feels you can qualify, let’s get you  into that home (someday). Time Frame: 90 Seconds! 73

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES©  The Break My Heart Rule  Getting G.U.T.S. Insurance Most amateur salesmen, when they finally make a sale, take the  money or contract and run. This is the worst move you can make  because you stand a great likelihood of getting a broken heart the  next day when the client calls, texts or emails and then cancels.  Prospect Leaves Heartbreak Voice Mail: Hello, Mr. Amateur  Salesman. We thought about it and we’re going to hold off for now.  Really appreciate all your time and lunch and the lattes were great.  We will get back to you someday. Thanks again, Bye-Bye.  Craaaaack. The salesman just had his heart broken. Guess whose  fault that is? You’re right, it’s the Salesman’s fault because he didn’t  have the GUTS to anticipate his worst nightmare, the Prospect  reneging on the deal. We all think about the possibility or push it way  deep into the recesses of our brain.  What they Are Really Thinking:  Amateur Salesman:  76

I had better slow things down a bit and do some more  research and shopping around. I will just text him to rip up the  order and call me in 2 weeks.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That was a good sale and the Prospect is  wonderful to do business with, but I better act cool and get myself  renege insurance so they will not back out later. Here goes……  Mr. Prospect: I am really looking forward to doing business with  you. We made the decision to work on your deal rather quickly, but  I know that you are a man of your word. Are you comfortable with  the decisions we made today? You aren’t going to break my heart  and call me tomorrow are you? If you want to do that, let’s just rip  up the contract and check right now. What do you think?  Make sure you get specific commitments when dealing with money,  payments, descriptions, time frame and the rest. Don’t grab the order  and leave without taking out a G.U.T.S. Renege Insurance Policy. You  will never have your heart broken again in Business.  77

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Never get into a  Pissing Contest  with a Skunk Rule   Control your emotions like Mr. Spock of Star Trek®. Ever get into a heated conversation with a prospect? They get loud, so  you get louder. The dialogue gets faster, heated, argumentative,  talking over each other, like some news talk shows do. You get  emotional, as does the prospect. The result: no sale.  I ask myself the same Question everyday: Why am I in Business?  Answer: To Make Money today! Yes, we have all met the nasty prospect, the malcontent. The person  who is having a bad day and they intend to make your day worse.  They are looking for a fight and you happen to be in the right place at  the wrong time. You are their convenient new punching bag.  Prospect: Why should I work with you?  Amateur Salesman: Because we are the best, Mr. Prospect. We  have been in business for 100 years. Let me tell you all about it.  This is the beginning of the end for our Amateur Salesman. He will  get into a long discourteous discussion with the prospect, be  defensive and probably get sucked into the emotional vortex. No Sale  and he will be depressed for the rest of the day unless he can shake  this off. This may result in fewer calls because, who wants a repeat of  this incident?  78

## Page 79

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Prospect: Why should I work with you? All you Salesmen sound  the same.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Maybe we shouldn’t work together Mr.  Prospect. I was thinking the same thing. Where should we go from  here?  Prospect: Wow! You have a lot of nerve!  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You might say that, but before I go, I get the  feeling that you are really mad at me. Not sure what I did, so please  tell me what I did wrong so I can apologize.  Prospect: Ok, OK, I can see we’re not getting anywhere. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Maybe not, but before I go, what is the real  issue here? Why are you even interested in my Product/Service?  Why did you initiate this meeting? How are you going to solve your  financial problems without a quick solution?  Prospect: That’s a lot of questions  G.U.T.S. Salesman: You are correct, Sir. Let me tell you  something before I go, as I have a lot of appointments today. After I  leave here (or get off the phone) you will think about what I said and  you will have REGRETS that you didn’t listen to my solutions. How  about we start all over and get something positive done here today  or should I leave?  Prospect: I can see you are no pushover. Ok, let’s talk some more.  As you can see, our G.U.T.S. Salesman controls himself and remains  an unemotional, mature and logical adult salesman. He doesn’t  respond or react to the angry Prospect’s emotional comments. He  takes the high road and hopes to eventually make the prospect realize  his own bad behavior, but he is prepared to fire him and walk away.  He still has a chance to make a sale or fire the prospect as he sees fit,  rather than ruin his day. Sometimes you have to act like a Vulcan  (Mr. Spock) and remain logical and avoid the drama of an  unreasonable or impolite Prospect. Remember in G.U.T.S., the  Salesman has Rights in the selling process.  The Salesman Always Comes first in G.U.T.S.!  79

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Don’t Pee on my back and tell me  it’s raining!  It’s time to change the way we communicate in  Sales. A long time ago, a friend of mine from Kentucky  used a wonderful expression that I found funny.  “Don’t pee on may back and tell me it’s raining!”  It literally means, let’s stop the Bullshit because I am not Dumb!  Having an honest dialogue with the prospect is essential for getting to  the coveted adult to adult conversation, a veracious chat. This is  where you are really communicating openly. An honest and trusting  conversation absent of obfuscation, pretentiousness and  manipulative games.  This could be compared to a Doctor-Patient Dialogue. So often there  is a cat and mouse game by the prospect and amateur Salesman. Ask  yourself why?  The Prospect has a Problem, a Need or Greed and is looking for a  resolution that your product or service can resolve, but is defensive  based on previous negative experiences by the typical and obvious  tacky Salesman. This leads the Prospect to protecting themselves  with non specific statements and even lying to avoid any form of  commitment.  The self serving salesman has a problem, too. He is only interested in  giving a useless presentation, asking several times for an order or  80

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© commitment without regard to the true needs of his prospect. He is  using a tired script instead of asking smart G.U.T.S. style diagnostic  questions. He rarely listens to the prospect or tries to discover their  true needs, time frame, finances or motivation.  Is it any wonder that the prospect behaves in such a defensive way?  Approaching the Prospect and throwing away the old fashioned  traditional and customary sales approach presentations will only gain  him respect. It will also allow the salesperson (and the prospect) to  relax and approach the sale in an entirely new and refreshing  approach.  This is why the Agenda step in G.U.T.S. is so crucial in getting the  dialogue between two strangers into the right environment. It’s so  honest and as Dr. Eric Berne, the Father of Transactional Analysis  would say, it’s an Adult to Adult conversation.  Ms. Prospect, would you do me a favor at the end of our  conversation and please fire me.  This is not something that most prospects expect to hear and it might  even throw them off balance. It also might gain the salesman veracity,  a bonding, a relationship of trust.  We need to think, act differently and learn how to have fun and  unbelievable Profitability in Sales. All it takes is some G.U.T.S. and  no one will ever say to you:  “Stop Peeing on my back and tell me it’s raining”:-)  81

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© It takes G.U.T.S. to Rule the World  You have to act like a Millionaire, a Winner  even if you don’t have 2 nickels to rub  together. This might upset those of pure  heart, but sometimes you do have to fake it  until your make it.  People love a winner and have no time for a loser. The opening of the  movie Patton with George C. Scott begins with his speech declaring  that “Americans love a winner and will not tolerate a loser,  Americans play to win all the time.”  People constantly tell me that they are not ready to get started in  their own business. “Claude it’s easy for you, you already have a  successful business, but I am just getting started.” I hear people like  Gary Vaynerchuk extoll the virtues of patience, while I believe that  “Impatience is a Virtue”. Don’t wait for things to happen, make them  happen. Take reasonable risks, try new things, learn from the  experience, even if it is disappointing. So much can be learned from  the experiences you encounter in sales. Waiting for the right moment,  which may never come. Playing it safe is not what entrepreneurs do.  What do the Marines say entering battle, “do you want to live  forever?” I meet people who tell me, “Claude I am willing to do  whatever it takes to become successful, financially free. I am an  entrepreneur.” Then I ask them to make 5 phone calls a day to new  prospects. When I follow up and ask if they have made the calls, the  excuses begin! All they have to do is pick up the phone and speak to 5  people a day and the magic will begin, they will start making money!  It really does takes G.U.T.S. to rule the world. The question is, are  you ready to do something or accept mediocrity as a lifestyle choice?  82

I will let all his future calls go to voice mail until  he leaves me alone. I hope he never calls again. He tried the old price  goes up on Friday routine with me. Nothing there with that guy. He  wouldn’t shut up and listen to me. I don’t trust him.”  We need to anticipate, Plan in advance and think about what we want  the prospect to say before we get off the phone.  The techniques of The G.U.T.S. method is asking questions with  Stroking, Nurturing and Empathy. They can be invaluable when  speaking to a prospect. Always leave the door open for future  business.  Ask for additional appointments if the need is there. Offer an  incentive or reward. When you get off the phone you can easily  imagine them saying “I like that Salesperson. I think we should move  forward with him. I felt good about him him.”  83

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Don’t Take  Vacations-Live  Them  GUTS is a lifestyleA way of life  Ever go on a vacation from Hell?  How many times have you waited for those 2 lousy weeks from the  J.O.B., just to take the long awaited holiday to East Bumble, Arkansas  to see the world’s largest container of dental floss?  You have waited 52 weeks and then it happens:  The plane is delayed or the weather is so bad that people are building  Arks! The airport loses your luggage! You are in the middle seat  between the lady who keeps talking to you while you are trying to  sleep and the 350 pound dockworker with the 130 pound Rottweiler  comfort dog, under his seat. A baby on your tour bus just dropped a  load. The cheap hotel room that your brother-in-law, the travel agent  booked for you, has a private showing of your favorite musical “La  Cucaracha” every time you turn on the bathroom light! Bad Food that  leaves you praying to the porcelain god. The list goes on!  We all have travel horror stories like this and probably worse. I am  Not trying to bum you out about vacations, but my girlfriend of 32  years and I have come up with a far superior solution.  “Don’t Take Vacations when you can Live Them!”  84

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© There are no Bad  Prospects, only  Shitty Salesmen  "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”  Shakespeare’s, Julius Caesar  The above quote could easily apply to most of today’s traditional, or  as I refer to them, “Amateur Salespeople”. How often do I hear the  excuses for failure in Sales? Too often and the excuses include: the  weather, the management, the economy, Divine intervention, Bad  Luck, politics, you get the idea.  But wait, it gets even worse! What the Amateur really loves to do is  cast all blame for their poverty/lack of success on the Prospect with  excuses like:  “They Lied to me.”  “They picked my brain and then said, I will think about it.”  “They made me drive 6 hours in traffic and never showed up!”  “They have no money.”  “They are time wasters.”  I often wonder if the Amateur Salesperson realizes that the reason for  their frustration is actually their own fault?  The Professional G.U.T.S. Salesperson, however, would say “it is my fault, I could have worked harder, it’s my responsibility, I should  have been smarter, etc.”  Max often said “the reason for an individual’s Success or Failure can  be found in the bathroom mirror!” While perhaps not as eloquent as  86

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© Mr. William Shakespeare, the point is the same. The G.U.T.S.  Salesman is taught to have high self esteem and unflinching  confidence. As we say, "The Salesman always comes first!”  Taking full responsibility is a pivotal philosophy of The G.U.T.S.  Salesman. The majority of other Sales training programs teach the  Salesman to be submissive, tolerant, understanding and to totally  give the prospect everything they want, without negotiating for  anything in return. Their hope rests in a voluntary reciprocation from  the prospect.  In the G.U.T.S. method, we believe it is inherent in human nature to  take advantage of the weak salesman without any regard for payback.  Let’s look at at some examples:  Prospect: Can you send me the outline and drawing of the new  designs we have in mind for the real estate office expansion? Amateur Salesman: I would be glad to Mr. Prospect. We are here  to give you everything you need to assist you with your decision. We  are a full service real estate company.  What They Are Really Thinking:  Prospect: This guy will save me a fortune in hiring an engineer  and architect and then I can shop around for a better price.  Amateur Salesman: This guy really owes me. I had better get this  contract, but I don’t want to appear too pushy.  ——————————————————————————————————-  The G.U.T.S. Salesman Role Play  Prospect: Can you send me the outline and drawings of the new  designs we have in mind for the real estate office expansion? It  would really help us to make a decision. We need to this project  completed before the end of the year.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I appreciate you asking for our assistance in  the new design and real estate purchase, Mr. Prospect. What you  87

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© are asking, however, is very costly and time consuming. I would  need to get approval from our CEO. When I call him, can I say that  we will have an exclusive contract signed, if we move forward with  your request?  Prospect: I’m not sure if we are ready to make a full commitment  like that. That’s a little fast for us. What They Are Really Thinking: G.U.T.S. Salesman: This company wants a lot of freebies, I had  better get a commitment first.  Prospect: This guy’s no pushover, like the other guy we used to use.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: I understand. We will have to charge you a  $10,000 design fee with the condition that we will waive or better  said, absorb that fee if we receive a signed contract. Can we agree  on that? Isn’t that fair and reasonable?  Prospect: Wow, our old guy never charged for this stuff.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s interesting. Just curious, why aren’t  you using him?  Prospect: Well, Errr, he went out of business a few months ago.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Unfortunate, sorry to hear that. Where should we go from here, Mr. Prospect? What They Are Really Thinking: Prospect: Darn he caught me.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Does he really think I don’t know what my  competition is doing out there. They went out of business because  they did free work for guys like this!  Prospect: I need to get this project done in the next 90 days.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Can I tell you the truth or just tell you a fable?  Prospect: The Truth, always. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s going to be next to impossible unless  we get started right away. I know you said your company would  rather move a little slower.  Prospect: Let’s just go ahead, I will sign the agreement if you can  provide the drawings and keep our time table.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you. 88

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© No One Deserves  Success More than   You  I have hundreds of Informational and hopefully,  Entertaining videos for the thousands of G.U.T.S. Sales Training  enthusiasts on youtube.com. At the end of each of my videos I always  say:  “No one deserves success more than you!”  That one sentence is one of my favorite Philosophical core beliefs, to  my loyal audience.  This has to be your belief, too. You have to be your own Cheerleader  in your personal life, as well as in business. A Successful G.U.T.S.  sales professional has no room for doubt, lack of self esteem or lack of  confidence. Even if you don’t have two nickels to rub together, you  have to believe that you are a deserving recipient from the fruits of  your labor.  I like seeing people fulfill their dreams. As I always say,  “Making a Sale is the 2nd best feeling in the world.”  What could be better than earning a prosperous living through the  sweat of your own brow and using your skills of Persuasion. Selling  products, services and solutions to people who want someone who  exudes likability, authority and who they can trust.  After attending, as well as being a keynote speaker at many business  training seminars, I have come to the following observations and  conclusions:  89

## Page 90

The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method RULES© *Most Attendees are well meaning and honest  *They are Hard Working  *They want to be part of The Great American Dream  *They embrace entrepreneurism, indomitable spirit and capitalism  *They are selfless. They want a better life not only for themselves, but  to provide a quality of life for their families. They want to take care of  their financial responsibilities and not be beholding to anyone or to  government supported charities.  *Most of all, They Want Freedom to live life under their own  terms.  Unfortunately, the missing ingredients which can give them the  freedom is not provided at learning institutions and commercial  motivational gatherings. Instead they are given 90% motivation and  inspirational platitudes, with little or no perspiration or education.  The result is an astronomical failure rate, based on my research.  Why? There is little, to no focus, on the Art and Science of Sales,  Persuasion and Influence. It is the essential key ingredient for  your success, as it has been for mine.  Contemporary Salespeople need an intense Focus with consistent  practice in order to become a master of Persuasion and Influence if  they want to achieve. Old school selling has been officially declared  dead.  Love live G.U.T.S. It’s a much better way to sell and live! Practice  the rules, utilize virtual attraction marketing, Speak to 5 Prospects  everyday and you will see the Magic happen in your life, as its has in  Mine!  “No One deserves Success more than you, dear reader!”  Thank you for Reading my Book.  90
