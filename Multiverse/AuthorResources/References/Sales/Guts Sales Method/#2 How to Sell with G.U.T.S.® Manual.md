Dedication This book is dedicated to all of you who are really sick and tired of sales  training programs that are nothing more than pie in the sky silly motivation  sessions. Heck, how many times can you walk on hot coals until you figure  out that all you’re getting is a hot foot?  You work hard, I mean really hard, go to all the biz op seminars, watch all  the infomercials with the folks by the pool holding the drinks with the little  umbrellas telling you how they got rich, but when you try, it doesn’t work!  It’s because Mr. Guru forgot the most important part of the program, Sales! This book is also dedicated to everyone who wants all that life has to offer  and who do not want to accept a life of mediocrity.  Thanks to Karen and John Klassen for participating in and providing the  Role-Plays. “We’re not gonna take it, never did and never will.” The Who Oh and before I forget, it’s inspired by a couple of kids from N.J. (Claude ,  Andy and Phil) who sold tools off of the back of a pickup truck. Man, now  there were a couple of characters with real GUTS. And, of course, Lovely  CJ who pulls my butt out of the fire by her excellent editing of the writing  mess I give her, every time I do one of these projects. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  5

THE G.U.T.S.™ WARNING! Warning! This is not a touchy feely, hug a tree, you and me, let’s  make friends, type sales manual. My Methods are not for everyone. They  are honest and direct, but designed to get you results. You may be uncomfortable in the beginning while learning. That is the price you will have to  pay for financial freedom! One student once asked whether learning my methods will be hard. I told  him that if he could stand with his pants falling down around his ankles in  the middle of a shopping mall, during the holiday season, then he would do  great with G.U.T.S.™! Let’s face it, modern sales is basically the same old repetitious ‘show and  tell’, just like we did in kindergarten. Get in front of as many prospects as  possible and tell them how wonderful your widget is, show them a slide  show, leave them with your glossy brochures and business card. Nothing is  new here, including the results! There is a difference for a few enlightened students who have studied the  art and science of persuasion. We have control, we decide how our time is  spent, we work smart, not hard and we have the income we deserve without the constant frustration and rejection. We become free when we discover and embrace a better way of doing business. It's a whole new way of question style selling that allows you to be in control, feel great and make the big bucks without making yourself into a  clown.   HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  6

Introduction  Please forgive, in advance, what I am going to say, but I think modern day  Sales Training is Bull Crap! Sales Training is literally stuck in the Stone  Age! It hasn’t changed since Levi Strauss peddled Blue Jeans. If you don’t  believe me, go to any weekend sales training seminar or read the slew of  book titles on Amazon.com. The contents are all the same, but said in different ways. • Ask for the order 5 times or more• • Pretentious bonding and rapport• • Be subservient to the needs of the prospect• • Stupid and obvious sales tricks• • Silly and useless sales tools• • Modeling• • Consultive selling• The list is endless! Sales training is a billion dollar information industry which is scared or unwilling to innovate, evolve, reinvent itself, take chances and it sure doesn’t  want to be politically incorrect. Sales may be the highest paid profession in the world, but truth be told, that  is only for the top 1% of salespeople. Those folks have adapted, evolved  and learned a process that understands the science and art of the power of  persuasion. For the remainder of the people, they change sales jobs like  you change your underwear.  Most people in sales find it intimidating and frustrating and they never make  enough money for all of their efforts. Here is my promise to you. If you take my principles of the G.U.T.S.™ Selling Method© and apply them  to your business or employment, you will see spectacular results. Your selfHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  7

esteem will increase. You’ll be working smarter. You will make a helluva lot  more money and have fun in the process. The G.U.T.S.™ Method is different from what you have probably heard  elsewhere. You’re not going to go out and give useless presentations.  You’re not going to ask for the order twenty times in a conversation with a  prospect who has no intention of buying. You won’t even go to meetings or  lunch dates unless you have a high likelihood of picking up a check or a  contract.  You will learn to work smart in a specific step-by-step process entitled the  Staircase of Success. You will learn Agenda, Qualify and Close. You will  memorize all the baby steps. You will be a master of opposite re-direction  and stealth techniques. Finally, you will discover that Sales is a Million Dollar skill that can make your life a dream come true. Who deserves it more  than You? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  8

Foreword There I was, my hand shaking as I had to face another prospect with another presentation. If it would only rain or there weren't any parking spaces  available, I would have the excuse I needed to return home and forget the  sales call. Maybe I could just use the phone instead. Who was I kidding? I  knew I wouldn’t make the calls. Who needs the pain and rejection. While  sales may be easy for others, to me it evoked emotions like frustration,  fear, anger and anxiety. I had tried all the sales seminars, all the business opportunities, worked for  Fortune 500 Companies, nothing seemed to bring me the prosperity and  enjoyment of life that I thought I could achieve. What was the answer? Why  could a few, a very few have it all and the rest of us end up on the couch of  life eating a bag of chips while watching the Brady Bunch film festival? If you have ever read anything about me, you know the three letter answer  and it was an old character who changed my life by the name of Max. He  was my Mentor and he taught me things about success, sales, real estate  and just about enjoying this short life to the “Max-imum”. Max always said  that life was too short to drink cheap wine, fly coach or drive a Yugo™. The  most important thing that I learned from Max was the art and science of  persuasion. He showed me how to actually control the sale, instead of leaving everything to chance. I don’t know about you, but all of my life, I have heard that sales is the  highest paying profession in the world. If you do research, you begin to realize that Bill Gates or Donald Trump are really salesmen; million dollar  salesmen. If they can do it, why can’t you? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  9

The G.U.T.S.™ Philosophy  AKA: Chutzpah Selling to the Max I don't know about you, but I have heard all my life that sales is the highest  paying profession in the world. Yet for many, it’s a struggle with tremendous  frustrations. Claude G.U.T.S.™ is more than a technique for increasing sales, it’s also a philosophy, an attitude, a way of life. High performance persuasion selling is  not for everyone. It's only for the few who are disciplined and hungry  enough to combine science and art to a higher understanding of human  behavior. When combined, the results are astounding. You are no longer  just a salesman, you are a highly skilled professional, an in demand speHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  10 Fake it until you make it! Work smart Time-Knowledge-Energy If your life stinks, it's your fault! "Want a friend-Get a dog"! SDS-No more begging & groveling The G.U.T.S.

Philosophy The G.U.T.S.™ Philosophy is designed to create the true professional; no less than a  doctor or lawyer. You must be perceived as someone whose time, knowledge and  energy is valuable. You are the expert, the problem solver. You do the diagnosis and  decide whether you have a likelihood of doing business or to just call it a day. Original Copyright Dec. 2005 All rights reserved www.ClaudeDiamond.com CC&R Property Investments, Inc. G.U.T.S.

cialist whose time, knowledge and energy is sought by many because it is  considered to be of high value. The initial premise of the G.U.T.S.™ philosophy is to be the best by acting  as though you already are. Now you may ask, how can I pretend I am a  heavy hitter, when I don’t have two nickels to rub together? You are going  to the esteemed University of Fake it, ‘Til you Make it! You are going to  take on the attitude of a winner; you will become one of the best salespeople in the world. You will become one of the top wage earners in your sales  profession by acting that way. People love to work with a winner and don’t  really tolerate or respect a loser. Sales is a combination of specific scientific skills and art. Now this may not  be in your nature right now, but that will change if you want to see different  results. I am going to ask you to change many things about the way you  feel about yourself and the way you sell which may not be easy. My methods will probably make you very uncomfortable at first. Are you all right with  that? Successful sales is about having the G.U.T.S.™, the sheer unmitigated gaul or chutzpah to ask the questions that others are too timid to  even consider.  Chutzpah defined: There was once a young man who was being sentenced by the court for the heinous murder of his parents. Upon rendering  sentencing by the judge he was asked if he could state anything on his own  behalf. He replied, Yes, your honor, please have mercy on me because  now I am an orphan. The meek may inherit the earth, but they will never become a master  G.U.T.S. salesman. In order to accomplish the things you want, you have to  lose the typical subservient salesman attitude. You have to seize control,  use modern tools, fire the prospect and spend your time with the more  likely or probable prospects. Let’s face it, haven't we all been in situations when you should have spoken up because you were treated with less than reasonable courtesy? How  about when the prospect lies or manipulates us with ‘I’ll think about it’ or ‘I  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  11

## Page 12

have to speak to my spouse’? How many times are you going to invest  time with someone who doesn’t even have the money to pay you? Why do  they treat salespeople like this? Do you have any rights in the sales process? You have to embrace a new philosophy. You have to stop acting as though  you are a little boy asking Mommy if it’s OK to take a cookie from the jar.  You must realize that all your problems in sales are with you, not your  prospects, not the economy, not politics, not the weather! If the customer  perceives you as someone who doesn’t respect himself, why should they  treat you any differently? Ask yourself this: Would potential customers treat  their doctor or attorney with the same regard as a widget salesman?  Ask yourself honestly if there was ever an occasion or time where a prospect missed an appointment, kept you waiting too long or treated you in a  way that was less than respectful? Here comes the tough part, it was your fault. Why? Because you failed to ask the tough questions up-front. You  tolerate it because you are desperate and the prospect knows it. The prospect will treat you with the same regard that you have for yourself. If they  sense that you are weak, complacent or a beggar, then they will take full  advantage of you.  A G.U.T.S.™ salesman is special and has no time for a prospect unless he  has been properly qualified and there is mutual respect. Think of it this  way, if you won the lottery and were now a millionaire, would you let any  prospect dump on you? What about all this rapport, bonding, relational and consultive selling that  you keep hearing about? Harry Truman said it best, If you need a friend,  then get a dog. Sales is about you, your success and prosperity. It’s about  you feeling so good about yourself and your product or service that everything else falls into place. I know all the books and seminars espouse the  win-win thinking and that the customer is always right. I want you to win  first. This may sound a little self-centered, but when you are on the phone  or have a face-to-face meeting, I want the prospect to feel like they have an  audience with the Pope, someone of importance and substance.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  12

## Page 13

You have to become a specialist, a professional. You are a problem solver  and as a professional you have to understand your place in the sales process. You will undertake the attitude of a skilled doctor or attorney. You are  dealing with patients or clients who need what you can provide. You will determine this by your examination, diagnosis, discovery or whatever you  want to call your line of questioning. G.U.T.S. is about making money and  feeling great about yourself all of the time. This results in truly being free,  it’s having a blank check for the rest of your life. Most salespeople do not realize that the only thing they have working for  them is what they know. So what do they do with their hard earned knowledge and experience? They give it away without any consideration or compensation and immediately diminish its value and even worse, lose all respect in the eyes of the prospect. Don’t give away anything until you find  out if he or she really need the service, are able to pay and will! The old fashioned way of sales, which is still practiced by the majority of  salespeople is to view the prospect as an adversary, someone to conquer,  to be tricked, someone who needs to be convinced, overwhelmed with  facts and information. The salesman has been taught to give presentations  and hopes to make such an impression with his knowledge base, that he  will make a sale.  The salesman will dispense information, talk in an obvious sales type language in an attempt to overcome objections, stalls and repeatedly ask for  the order. In some cases, he will use closing and manipulative techniques  that are obvious, which the prospect has heard before and may even be  using himself and possibly resents. Techniques like ‘we only have a few  left, better act quickly’ or ‘I’ve been authorized to make you this half price  offer if you act now’ are all designed to be obvious and result in a sale. In  reality, these techniques are an insult to the intelligence of the prospect.  These are transparent, old fashioned and cheesy sales moves. By acting  this way, the salesman becomes subservient to the prospect rather than  an equal or superior. He is a beggar rather than the professional that he  wants to be. He has no control in the sales process and is relegated to beHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  13

## Page 14

ing a professional gambler, a crapshooter who has no idea whether or not  he will prosper. He has diminished himself as less than an equal. He is  blindfolded and swinging away at the pinata. The prospects, realizing that most salespeople operate under this preprogrammed old fashioned sales method, takes advantage of this known behavior to their benefit. They get free information, prices, proposals, literature, even hands on assistance in their business without any commitment  given. I remember one prospect who asked me if he could borrow a  $50,000.00 piece of automotive equipment because his had broken. Man  was he in a jam! I pulled some strings and got him the equipment from my  company and he was able to continue to keep his business open and service his customers. Guess what he did? He returned our equipment when he  was done and bought a new setup from my competition. Whose fault was it? Mine. Why? I didn’t have the G.U.T.S.™ to get a commitment! I chickened out. It would have been so simple to lock him in, but I  didn’t have the chutzpah. Have you ever contemplated what you would do  differently if you had a second chance? Here’s mine. This is what it should have sounded like. Role-Play Example Prospect: Thanks for lending my business the equipment Claude, you  really helped us out. We are going to give you the highest consideration  when we go to buy a replacement. Claude: Thank you, Mr. Prospect. Does that mean we can do business in  the next 30 days if my equipment meets the needs of your office? Prospect: Maybe. Claude: Is there any reason why we couldn’t do business if my equipment  does the job? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  14

## Page 15

Prospect: Well, we are looking at other companies and they may be willing  to do better on price. Claude: Are they also willing to lend you a $50,000.00 piece of equipment  for 30 days without cost and in less than 24 hours notice?  Prospect: Good Point. You guys came through in a pinch. Claude: And we will come through after you buy the equipment, too.  Where should we go from here? Prospect: Let’s do it. Claude: Do what? Prospect: The deal, the deal. What are ya, deaf? Claude: No, I just like to hear good news twice. Thank you. The salesman usually gives everything that is asked for without receiving  anything in return. Salespeople need to be trained to have high selfesteem, the G.U.T.S.™ to ask the key questions first, before they give any  answers. The prospect lies, manipulates and evades any commitment. In many  cases, they treat the salesperson with disdain and very little, if any, respect  and the salesman accepts that as the price of his so called ‘profession’.  This is just the way things are, but not the way they have to be. Eventually,  the salesman becomes a real life Willy Loman from Arthur Miller’s Death of  a Salesman. He blames everyone; the prospect, his company, the economy, the government. Yes, he blames everyone except himself, the real  culprit for his lack of success and humiliation. He becomes despondent  from the continual rejection and lack of prosperity. Is it any wonder, that the  turnover rate for salespeople is the highest of any profession? Who wants  to go out into the world and be rejected all the time, day after day? Sales  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  15

has to be more than a simple numbers game, it has to be developed to  embrace skills and a specific G.U.T.S. philosophy. There has to be a behavior change if the modern salesperson is going to  work smart and profit. Questions are the answer, not the jabbering, senseless presentations or infinite unproductive door knocking. This is the  G.U.T.S.™ Philosophy. It’s not about the prospect, but about you. If you  think this is self-centered, then you are correct.

The Rules of G.U.T.S. Let me say up-front, that there will be a lot of rules in this G.U.T.S. Sales  Method©. When I hear the word ‘rules’, I feel a rebellious teenage instinct  arise in me!  Many of these rules will be contradictory to what you know or opposite of  what you have learned from other sales training courses, seminars, books,  and CDs. My rules may even upset you; they will definitely upset some of  your prospects because you are not acting like a typical salesman.

G.U.T.S.™ Method is based on getting to the bottom line quickly, working  smart, gaining trust and feeling great about yourself by eliminating time  wasting, indecisive, lying and broke prospects. It’s all for a purpose, too. It’s  to allow you to have a blank check in front of you for the rest of your life. If  that’s important to you, then read on, learn, memorize, practice and implement these rules. If you are in business for any other reason, then read no  further, give me a call and I will set you straight :-) Do you suffer from the agony of Premature Presentation? Old fashioned salesmen can’t wait to give their Power Point slideshow, hand out  brochures, give away business cards and answer countless, never ending  questions. If they would only exercise some restraint and not give away  their most prized asset, their specialized knowledge. Salespeople only  have one advantage in the world of competitive sales and that is what they  know and what the prospect does not know. Wouldn’t it be wiser to feign  ignorance while learning the needs and greeds of the prospective client?  How do you get them involved and passionately wanting to buy when you  are boring them to death by talking too much? Professionals don’t sell  when they can make the prospect buy. Hold back the goodies until you are  ready to kill. No more Pro-Bono Work for free? No, not me! Bad poetry aside, you  had better decide whether you are in business to make a profit or to start  The Lonely Salesman Society. No more Free Lunches. Stop giving free  information to unqualified prospects who just want to pick your brain for  free. They want you to solve their problems without any consideration of  compensation. Your time, knowledge and energy have value, but only if you  show others that you respect yourself.   Hey! The library is now closed! Claude Tip: The best way to get off the phone with a time waster is to ask  for money :-) All Prospects Fabricate, Confabulate and Prevaricate all the time. Note: This is Claude fancy talk for the word ‘lie’. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  18

## Page 19

The 11th Commandment - Moses dropped one on the way down the  mountain. Prospects can lie all they want to a salesman and still get into  heaven. They lie because this is their fire escape mechanism against  salesmen from whom they wish to escape without stress, arguments or  embarrassment. The solution to having an honest dialogue is to never act  like a salesman, be a professional. Think about it for a moment. When  you go to your trusted doctor, attorney, or accountant with a problem, you  tell the truth and give all of the facts to obtain a quick cure or resolution for  a need, problem, ailment, etc. No More “Show and Tell”. Giving away your hard earned information is  against the law in the G.U.T.S. Method. You only have one advantage over  the prospect in sales and it’s what you know. The typical salesperson is  trained to demonstrate, share information and then ask for the order with  miniscule discovery. The G.U.T.S. expert guards his knowledge and declines to give unprofitable presentations. Give no features and benefits until you have completely qualified the prospect. You need to know that: · they want to buy something · they have some needs or greeds · they have the money/finances to buy your services/products · they are ready to make a commitment Begging: Never beg for the sale (when you can make them give it to you).  Yup, begging, that’s what traditional salespeople do! They beg, plead, ask  countless times for the order and sometimes whine (very annoying), for the  order. I don’t even want you to ask for the sale unlike other sales training  programs. I want the prospect to come to their own natural and logical conclusion to give you the order. Remember, everyone loves to buy, but no  one wants to be sold.  People are really sick and tired of the traditional, old fashioned salesperson  who does a lot of tricky maneuvering, duplicitous closes, high pressure and  so forth. They are literally dying to meet an honest and straight forward  salesman. If the prospect doesn’t buy from you because they don’t have  the need, the money, the timeliness or because it’s not within their comHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  19

mitment process, that’s OK because it’s now over in the first couple of minutes - with the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©. Wouldn’t you rather find all this  out in the first couple of minutes of conversation? You are earning what you feel you are worth! Remember author and  motivational speaker Napoleon Hill’s famous quote from his bestselling  book, Think and Grow Rich, ‘thoughts are things’. The theory basically was  that a guy who works at the local burger joint flipping burgers is earning  $9.00 per hour and then gets fired. What happens next? He is probably going to seek similar employment at another fast food establishment at the  same hourly pay scale. This is not because he is incapable of earning  more, it’s just because he believes that he is only worth this amount of  money. Our burger flipper thereby remains within the same economic pay  scale. If you want to become a millionaire salesman, then you had better  emulate one.  Claude Note: Oh boy, I could write another book on this topic alone and  believe me I am not a psychobabbler! Be a Doctor, a Lawyer and a Thespian - The true professional salesman  has to wear many hats and takes on multiple roles to become successful.  In terms of the G.U.T.S. Method we use the science and understanding of  basic human behavior, AKA: psychology. We know that by asking questions  correctly, we can not only gain important insights and information, but also  create motivation that leads to profitable sales. Think about it, what do professionals like doctors and lawyers do in order to diagnose or ascertain the  needs or problems of their clients? They ask questions like ‘where does it  hurt?’, ‘what is the problem?’, ‘why are you here?’, ‘what would you like me  to do today?’ and ‘what actions are you prepared to take?’ They also do a bit of academy award winning acting, ergo the thespian/ actor role is also necessary. They take on this role while asking these questions. This behavior allows the G.U.T.S. professional to embrace the ‘Work  Smart’ concepts that make this method unique. Congratulations, you are  now enrolled in the esteemed University of Fake it, ‘til You Make It! HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  20

Claude Note: Much more on this subject during Mentoring sessions. Questions and redirections with stealth. You need to ask the tough  questions that the amateurs and cowards are afraid to ask. This is Chutzpah to the Max.  Claude Note: Sometimes I refer to G.U.T.S. Selling as ‘Chutzpah Selling’.  Always return a question with a question, but with finesse and stealth in order to qualify and get commitments quickly. This is tricky and will take practice because you do not want the prospect to know what you are really trying to accomplish. Compare this to the therapist who asks questions to gain  insight into the needs of his or her patient. Example: Prospect (with an attitude): Tell me about your widgets! Salesman: I don’t know! Prospect (now excited, raising voice and getting passionate, intense): What  do you mean you don’t know; you’re the salesman! Claude Note: The G.U.T.S. salesman realizes that people only take an action and commit to business because of an urgent need or greed. They  have to leave their safe and secure academic, logical or analytical state of  mind and become somewhat hysterical. Salesman (recovery): What I meant Mr. Prospect, is that I don’t know which  products you mean. We have a very extensive line and different price  ranges. Can you help me out and tell me why you think you even need a  widget?  Prospect: I know all about widgets. In fact, we have been using the ABC  line for years now. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  21

Salesman: That’s great, they are a well respected manufacturer of widgets.  I am a little confused and maybe you can advise me. If you are already using the ABC line, why are we talking today? Prospect: I just want to check out what your company can offer us. Salesman: I am still having trouble here, Mr. Prospect. ABC is probably  selling you an excellent product at a fair price, right? Prospect: Yea, they’re OK.  Salesman: If there was something they could improve, what would that be? Claude Note: The old fashioned salesman, when invited to speak, begins  a rambling presentation that goes on about the entire line, rather than asking stealth questions. Prospect: We’ve had some problems with quality control and delivery  times. Salesman: That’s a common problem in our industry. I am sure it couldn’t  be that big a problem with ABC, is it? Prospect: It’s big enough to get my butt hauled into the district manager’s  office. He is not a happy guy! Salesman: I appreciate your sharing your insights and situation. I know that  you are very busy, so let me get to the bottom line. Suppose I could resolve  your problems with widgets in the next 30 days and could guarantee delivery and quality. Could we get a one year commitment from you for monthly  orders? Prospect: Would you be able to do that for the same price as ABC? I know  you charge more than they do. Salesman: Let’s pretend that I could, what would your response be? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  22

Prospect: We probably could give you an order. Salesman: Probably YES or probably NO? I need a definitive answer if I  am going to call my boss and ask for a one year waiver on price. Prospect: OK-OK, I see where you are going with this. If you can assure  me delivery, quality and hold the price, I will have a purchase order in your  hands today. Claude Note: The beauty of this dialogue is that in just a few moves our  G.U.T.S. salesman has identified the buyer’s needs, fanned the flames a bit  and capitalized on the present problem with a profitable one year contract.  The adept salesperson uses questions with finesse, redirection, stealth and  a firm commitment. He didn’t give an extensive presentation and was fully  prepared to leave quickly (fire the prospect). No more phony and pretentious bonding and rapport! Many sales  seminars and courses today are still teaching the phony baloney approach  to sales. If the buyer likes me, then I will sell more. I have always felt that  giving a good product or service with excellent value will do more for your  relationship than commenting on the lovely family photos on the desk.  What’s so wrong with getting to the bottom line as fast as possible with intelligent questions and redirections? Mr. Prospect, why am I here? What would you like to see my (company,  product or service) do for you? What are the problems you are experiencing? What do I need to do to get your business commitment today? Do you  have money set aside to purchase my product/service if it meets with your  needs? Could you share that amount with me? What is the decision making  process for your company? Always create an Agenda up-front before you start selling. Tell them what is going to happen so there are no surprises and you stay in  control. It’s like going to AAA (American Automobile Association) and getting a roadmap before you take a long journey. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  23

## Page 24

Example: Mr. Prospect, I will be asking you a few key questions to determine if my product/service meet with your needs and the amount of funds  you are comfortable spending. While I hope we do business today, I want  you to be comfortable enough to also tell me you don’t need my product or  service, if it is not what you are looking for. Is that OK with you? Qualify in the first 3 minutes or get out: I will make this rule really simple, YOU CANNOT SELL EVERYONE! Any so called ‘sales educator’ who  tells you differently is blowing smoke up your chimney. I learned from my  mentor that the reason most salespeople fail is because they waste so  much of their natural resource, (time) on unproductive prospects. This  eventually leads to frustration and resignation. Your ego, self-esteem and  self-worth can only take so much. You must learn to be straightforward,  seize control and determine whether there is any potential for a profitable  situation in a few minutes. You may not close your prospect in 3 minutes,  but you may get a tentative commitment or at the least, an inkling of  whether there is something there for your efforts. At the least, you are able  to dismiss or fire the prospect with finesse and move on to another opportunity which may have a more profitable ending. I even use my famous 3 minute timer to keep me on track. Yes, in many a  case, it might take longer than 3 minutes, but the point is to eliminate unproductive and unlikely prospects as politely and as quickly as possible.  The benefits are enormous because it allows you to feel great about yourself. You are in charge. Fire the Prospect! - In my rule book, it’s OK to fire the prospect! If in  your qualification of a prospect you discover that there is a need, but not  the funds to purchase your solution or if the prospect is incapable or not in  authority to make a commitment, then it is your RIGHT and your DUTY to  fire them. I can’t tell you how often I have spent time with potential clients  who were just wasting my time, using me while trying to get free information out of me or they were having a bad day so they wanted to make mine  worse. The worst part of it all was that I knew what was going on and I tolerated it. As Max would say, if you want to find the source of your problem,  just go look in the bathroom mirror. It’s OK to fire a Prospect. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  24

Claude Tip: If you really want to be a stinker and have some fun at the  same time, then refer the (time wasting) prospects to your competition and  let them waste their time and resources ;-) Claude Tip: Keep an up-to-date database with your notes on nonperforming prospects. If, in your discovery process, you find that there is no  money to purchase your goods, make a note of it. If they contact you in the  future, you are armed and prepared. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, it’s so great to hear from you again and I hope we  can find a way to do business today. If you don’t mind, I would like to ask  you a question. Last time we spoke, you mentioned that money was an issue. How has that situation changed so we can make a commitment to do  business today? Make your Prospects Miserable! Prospects do not buy because of sales talk and fancy brochures. They buy  because they have a passionate need or greed that hopefully your product  or service can repair. Make sure that you always ask the question that  leads to a higher state of misery. Review their motivations. Try to get 3-6  of them, repeat them often and get a commitment or get out! Salesman: Mr. Prospect you have a real problem here and it’s probably  costing you a great deal of anxiety and expense. I can appreciate your  situation, as I know from other clients how this type of situation can render  a great toll. Let me ask you something before I get off the phone. Suppose  for a moment that there was a solution for your situation that could be implemented quickly and could work within your financial constraints; what  would you do? You wouldn’t take an action today would you? It’s OK to tell  me, ‘No’. Life is too short to make cold calls. I always hated cold calls because I felt like I was intruding on someone.  Prospects feel like they have the right to be curt with you because of your  uninvited invasion. By the way, they may be right! HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  25

One of my mentor Secrets of Success was to learn how to convert all sales  calls to warm or hot calls. You will first need to set up a G.U.T.S. prospecting system so you have all of the leads you will ever need. (More on this  later in the book.) You need to practice the law of attraction marketing by  creating an incentive for the prospect to either come to you or volunteer  their contact information.  Claude Tip: I always offer free ebooks, audio CDs, newsletters and more  on my multiple web pages and blogs. In return, I receive their contact information. Now here is where we see the genius of my Mentor Max. He  used to say to me: Always act like you are getting back to them or returning a call! Personally, I know that I hated calling potential prospects and getting all  that rejection, but on the occasion where the prospect called me for more  information, I flew to the phone to return the call because they invited the  call. Max said that all you had to do was create an incentive where they  gave you the contact information and then proceed to act as though you  are getting back to them. A salesman making a warm phone call: Hello, Mr. Smith. I have a message here that you contacted my office and I  am getting back to you. How can I help you? A salesman encountering the guardian at the gate! Receptionist: Hello ABC, how can I help you? Salesman: Hi, my name is Claude Diamond. I have a note here that Ms.  Smith contacted my company, so I thought I better get back to her. Receptionist: What company are you with? Salesman: The Diamond Consulting Group. Do you know what this is  about? Why did Ms. Smith contact us? Is she a salesperson? Receptionist: I will put you through. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  26

Rule: If you act like a typical salesman, you won’t be treated like the  professional you are. Note: Sales is like chess, you had better be several moves ahead of  the prospect! You Can’t Sell Everyone! Most salespeople expend too much time and  energy with time wasters. Qualify in 3 minutes or less, make the sale or get  out! Learn the work smart principle of success. People love to buy, but  hate to be sold. A professional never has to beg or use tricky trial closing  questions to get the order. She qualifies the prospect with finesse and  leads him to make his own logical decision. Change and Evolve constantly! In the course of doing business, you  must constantly re-engineer, adapt, create and be innovative. You must be  in a constant state of flux while the copycats are static. Why, because if  you’re doing it well, your competition will always attempt to emulate you.  Keep everyone guessing about you all of the time. Be a leader and you will  never have to worry about the competition; you can just let them worry  about you. Always innovate; never emulate! Always look for the boss, not his horse. When seeking new business go  to the top and work your way down, instead of from the bottom, up. How  many times have you wasted your resources on people who were incapable of rendering a decision or were without the proper authority? It takes  Chutzpah, but I always find out who the boss is. Work Smart! Sales is a million dollar skill if you are using a method that  gives you control, is profitable, makes you feel great about yourself and is  fun. You should feel like life has given you a blank check with an unlimited  balance! You want to do business with people, but wouldn’t you rather hear  the word “no” up-front in the first three to five minutes, or would you rather  hear it after investing hours, days, weeks or months? The bottom line is  that I’d rather get the “no prospects” up-front so I can get on with my life,  talk with other people and do more deals. This is part of the ‘work smart’  concept in the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©. In working smart, we have to think  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  27

## Page 28

about why people buy our products and services. What’s the motivating  factor?  I like to use the painful analogy of the dentist. Nobody really wants to go to  the dentist, but in many cases we have to go. Imagine if you had a toothache on Christmas morning. There was no dentist office open and this  toothache was really killing you. You went through the phone book and you  called dentist after dentist after dentist. You finally got a dentist on the  phone who said to you, Sure, I’ll open up my office and I’ll take care of that  tooth, but I’ll have to charge you up-front. I won’t take your Blue Cross or  an HMO card. Are you really going to argue with that dentist at that point,  if you’re truly in agony? Of course not! Are you going to negotiate? Are  you going to ask for literature, for references? Are you going to say you’ll  think about it? Talk to your spouse? Of course not. You’re going to run to  that dentist’s office. You’re going to write him a check or hand over cash  for whatever amount he asks because you are ready to buy, there is a  great sense of urgency and you are in no position to negotiate. There is no  decision making process here, your tooth hurts! You are in great need.  The high achieving salesman is able to recognize these ardent situations  and capitalize on them. He truly understands why people buy things. They  may rationalize a purchase academically to themselves and third parties,  but in all honesty, they purchased it for a personal reason.  Claude note: The above rule was one of the hardest for me to learn because I was taught that people buy for external reasons (bells and whistles,  sizzle not the steak, etc.). Max explained it to me one day in a simple anecdote that made it all crystal clear: A man pulls into his driveway with a brand new and very expensive German luxury vehicle. His nosy neighbor, upon spying the new addition,  crosses the street and asks why he bought the costly car. Taking great  pride in his response, the car owner begins to regurgitate everything he  heard from the car salesman and what he gleaned from the brochures  about the engineering marvel, the safety features and lower depreciation of  cars in this class. The neighbor was in awe of the vehicle and said he  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  28

## Page 29

hoped that someday he too, could afford a car like this. He wished him well  and returned to his own home. The actual truth of the matter is that the owner bought the car, not because of all the features and accessories, but because of the reaction of his  neighbor. It bolstered his ego and made a statement of his prosperity and  supposed superiority. He felt that a car like this told the world that he is better than his peers. So in reality, he bought the car because of ego or lack  of it (internal), but justified the purchase by talking about other things (external). If you were an expensive German car salesman and understood  this principle how would you approach your prospects? The Millionaire Mindset - The Greatest Rule: If you want to become a  millionaire you had better emulate one. That they work hard is a given, but  they also work smart. They guard their natural resources. They know that  they only have so many hours in a day, the same as anyone else. The only  difference is that they have greater productivity than the average person  who squanders his time. If you want to be a millionaire then hang around  with one.     HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  29

G.U.T.S.™ Questions   Now that you know some of the rules and philosophies of the G.U.T.S.™  Sales Method©, you need to learn the heart and soul of my Sales Method;  you have to learn how to ask Questions. Yes, questions are asked in special ways, in much the same way that other professionals such as doctors,  lawyers and investigators are taught. In sales, we need a method for obtaining urgent information to make crucial, timely and profitable decisions. How do we qualify people quickly?  How do we determine if we have a prospect or a tire kicker time waster?  We use a process that I like to call The G.U.T.S. Discovery Method. This  is the strategy that really makes the whole thing work. It is learning how to  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  30 Minus Plus Opposite Re-Direction Multiple Choice Ignorant Open Closed Types Being a Thespian Being unemotional Courtesy Compliment Finesse 8. Questions Questions are the means of gaining enough information to ascend the staircase.  Remember no pro bono. You have the objective to gain the information you need first  from the prospect. You work smart! There are many types of questions you can ask to  gain information, but you always have to use finesse in order to keep the prospect from  feeling like they are being interrogated. Re-Direction is essentially where you use your  understanding of common sense human behavior. In many cases, you go in the  opposite direction that is expected to get the answer you want. This is to get the  prospect thinking about their own motivation. Copyright Dec 2005 All rights reserved www.ClaudeDiamond.com CC&R Property  G.U.T.S.™

ask questions in a special way, The G.U.T.S. Way, with our secret ingredient called an understanding of human behavior and response or finesse. Most sales training methods are based on dispensing free information  without regard to whether or not your time is being well spent. It’s just what  you are supposed to do, said one trainer at a seminar I attended. What so  many of us do is talk and give it all away, but ask for nothing in return.  Some would consider that asking aggressive, intrusive and pushy questions. I strongly disagree. As I said earlier, we have rights in the process.  We have the right to get information. After a while, questions by their very  nature, become aggravating and annoying. Nobody wants to be pummeled  with questions from a salesperson who is seemingly trying to pry to make a  sale. Claude Note: Ever sit in a room of kindergarten kids and listen to all of the  why questions? Questions are the means to propel ourselves up the Staircase of Success,  step-by-step. (More on this in forthcoming chapters). Unlike our sales counterparts, we are not just going to give a verbal or Power Point presentation.  We are going to ask strategic questions, but in a style I call “Finesse”. I define Finesse questioning as follows: A sales situation which requires an artful and tactful handling of a difficult or  normally uncomfortable situation. Finesse can be accomplished in many ways using:  A. Permissions B. Compliments C. Remaining Unemotional D. Becoming a Thespian E. Using Stealth We will talk to people and formulate our questions so they do not sound so harsh or adversarial and allow us to gain control and have an advantage. Claude Note: For those of you who are uncomfortable with all this planning  in advance and tactics that we will be using in G.U.T.S., consider it like a  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  31

chess game. In professional chess, which is an historical game of war, you  plan your moves and anticipate your opponent’s countermoves. Champion  chess players are capable of great depth and foresight in planning several  moves in advance. Becoming financially successful in sales should require  no less. Hey Ma, it’s a jungle our there! Here are a few role-play examples: Permissions: G.U.T.S. Salesman: Ms. Prospect, would you mind if I ask you a few questions to save us both some time and allow me to see if I can help you? Notice how you are asking permission first. Never underestimate the power of  old fashioned good manners. There will be more on the topic of asking  permissions in the Agenda section of the manual. Compliments: Prospect: Do your widgets come in other colors? G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s an excellent question, Mr. Prospect. Why did  you bring that up? Remaining Unemotional (Act like Mr. Spock of Star Trek™.): Prospect: I am very upset about your company’s new shipping policy. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I can understand your concerns, would you like to discuss our new policy? Becoming a Thespian: G.U.T.S. Salesman: Glad we could do business today, Mr. Chardonnay.  Let’s celebrate by going out to lunch. My treat, anywhere you like. In ‘N Out  Burger, Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, Magiannos Italian, you decide. Prospect: I love the little place on Houston Avenue that serves the best anchovy burgers you’ve had. I am feeling like celebrating, so maybe I will be  extravagant and have some limburger cheese melted on top. Let’s wash it  all down with a bottle of their best freshly squeezed Hungarian onion and  beet juice. Isn’t that the best meal you could imagine? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  32

## Page 33

G.U.T.S. Salesman: It’s like no meal I could ever imagine ;-( Claude Note: Sometimes in business, you just have to pretend that you  won the Academy Award. It’s the price we pay for financial freedom. Please  pass the fresh squeezed onion-beet juice. Stealth:  Receptionist: Hello, Save the Tofu Fund, how may I help you? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Hello, I’m getting back to your CEO, Mr. Pinot Noir. Receptionist: Is he expecting your call? G.U.T.S. Salesman: I am not sure. I’m just getting back to him. Do you  know what this is about? Is he trying to sell me something? Receptionist: I don’t know, but I will put you through. Pinot Noir: Hello, Noir here. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Hi, Mr. Noir. My name is Claude Diamond. Do you  know why I am calling you, I have your number here.  Pinot Noir: Never heard of you. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Your company doesn’t have any interest in expanding  its marketing presence and increasing donations for Tofu aid an additional  25% in the next 30 days? Pinot Noir: Perhaps, tell me what you have in mind. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Tell you what, get out your iPhone and let’s schedule a  short meeting. How is Tuesday for you? You don’t like anchovy burgers do  you? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  33

## Page 34

OK, you get the picture on how using a little finesse can make your life  easier, open some doors and generate greater sales. Now let’s discuss  how you can use questions to retain control throughout the entire process.  Redirection: The average salesperson, when asked a simple question by a prospect,  will usually try to show off their knowledge base by replying with an immediate answer. Claude Note: In the G.U.T.S. Method, unless it serves your needs, it is not  in your best interest to answer any question(s) posed by the prospect unless it serves an immediate and profitable need. In answering questions  posed without redirection, you are rendering control and becoming subservient to the prospect. In the G.U.T.S. Method, we use a technique used by other professionals  called redirection. That is answering a question with another question. We  employ the methods of finesse which were discussed earlier in this chapter  so as not to annoy or aggravate the prospect. We use redirection in order  to Work Smart during the discovery phase. Working smart means retaining  control, spending time, knowledge and energy profitably and feeling great  about ourselves during the sales process. Claude Note: I can’t tell you how wonderful it feels as the salesman, to  have choices as to whether to continue with a potential client or just dismiss or as I say, fire the prospect with finesse. No more pretentious lying  and manipulation by the prospect. We have the control. Let’s do a comparative role-play to demonstrate a redirection. Prospect: How long can I rent this property? Typical Salesman: One year, with a right to renew for another year. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  34

## Page 35

G.U.T.S. Salesman: Great question, Mr. Prospect. Help me out here. What  exactly were you looking for? You must have asked about the length of the  lease for an important reason; would you mind sharing that with me? Now you see, the way I did it - with finesse – it is hardly noticeable that I  turned the prospect’s question into my question, thereby getting out of having to answer questions while getting more information from the prospect. Let’s continue the Redirection role-play. Prospect: I need a property for at least two years because that’s how long  my company requires me to stay in the area.  Typical Salesman: That’s great, I have several two year home properties  available, but they may not last long.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: So if I understand you correctly, if we can locate a  property that meets with your particular needs, within your financial plan  and is a minimum of a two year lease, what would you want to do? Notice the difference in the techniques? The typical old fashioned salesman went for the obvious kill/close and applied the standard pressure. No  stealth whatsoever. On the other hand, our G.U.T.S. Salesman was tactful,  and reiterated the previous wants and needs of the prospect. Using a little  finesse he will either get a tentative commitment, an objection or obfuscation. Here’s another example. Suppose someone asks you for the price. The  prospect might say, How much is this house? How much are you selling it  for? You might say something like, It really depends, Mr. Prospect. Could  you give me an idea of what your budget is? What you’re looking to  spend? How much money do you have set aside for this? Maybe I could  work with you. Could you give me an idea please? Now you see, I never answered the question. I redirected it with finesse.  I’m trying to get the prospect to give us more information. Mr. Herb Cohen,  who wrote the wonderful book How to Negotiate Everything, said that the first to mention price, always loses. If you are asked a money question,  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  35

## Page 36

you want to redirect it or turn it around just like I did in the previous example, with finesse, so that the prospect gives you more information. Exception: If you have a prospect who is becoming irritated, make sure  that you offer them a multiple choice. Prospect: What is the price? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for asking, Mr. Prospect. We have several  purchase options depending on what you want to do. If you can close in 30  days with cash, 60 days with outside financing or if you require us to carry  some or all of the financing. Which of these is most comfortable for your financial situation? So remember, whenever you’re asked a question or whenever you are asking or answering a question, turn it into another question and use finesse.  Tie in a compliment before you ask another question. Turn your questions  around and smooth them over with finesse and redirection and you will  have an entirely different feel for sales. OK, let’s keep moving forward.  There are several different kinds of questions we can ask. When I was in law school they taught us by using a method called ‘Socratic  Teaching’. Socrates, the ancient philosopher, believed that the best way he  could teach his students was by turning their questions into his questions.  He wanted to make them think. He wanted them to find their own answers  and get emotionally and academically involved. We do the same thing here  in the G.U.T.S. Sales Method, with redirection. We have to ask questions  in different ways.  Positive/Negative Redirection - Sometimes asking a question in the  negative or positive can get you the answer or help you lead the prospect  to his own conclusions. Positive Redirection Role-Play HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  36

## Page 37

Prospect: I went to a sales seminar by Johnny T. gReed and it was a waste  of time and money. What do you think of him? Typical Salesman: Yea, I heard the same thing. He really stinks. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I am surprised to hear that. I have heard some good  things about him. What do you think was wrong with his seminar? What  would you like to see from my company if we decide to do business? By going in the opposite direction and being positive in a negative situation  we retain control, get more information from the prospect and take our conversation to a higher plane than our competitor. The typical salesman, by  jumping onto the bandwagon and bad mouthing his competitor with the  prospect, seems to take advantage and lose credibility in order to gain a  sale, at the expense of his own credibility. Negative Redirection Role-Play Prospect: I heard you have the best quality in the industry for widgets. Typical Salesman: That’s right, nobody makes a better widget than we do. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you, we probably make a very good widget, but  I don’t know if it is the best. Why did you think that we are the best, Mr.  Prospect? Prospect: Now wait a minute son, don’t argue with me. I have bought from  the other widget providers and their quality, price and customer service isn’t  even close to your company. So when I say you make the best, I know  what I am talking about. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Well sir, I was raised never to argue with higher intelligence. Tell me, how we can do business? Now I’m getting more information just by redirecting the question in a positive or negative tone. Hello, Reverse Psychology 101! I’m getting more information, so I can determine how I can do business. Remember, redirection can be positive or negative; go in the opposite direction of what your  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  37

## Page 38

prospect is expecting. Essentially, do the opposite of what the traditional  salesperson would do and watch the benefits. Open/Closed Questions and Redirections - Ask questions that either  give you more information or a quick ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer when it serves  your purposes. Open Question G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect what are your thoughts on our new line  of color widgets?  Prospect: Well, we seem to sell more of the yellow than the blue. G.U.T.S. Salesman: How many would you need if we could ....... Closed Question  G.U.T.S. Salesman: So we have the color and the price to fit your finances,  Mr. Prospect. Would you like us to deliver them in shrink wrap to protect  them from chipping? Prospect: Yes, as soon as possible. Ignorant Redirection - Sometimes the best answer is to feign ignorance  and gather more information. Prospect: Do your widgets come with rotary oscillators? G.U.T.S. Salesman: I don’t know, Mr. Prospect, that’s a good question.  Why did you bring that up? Prospect: We can only use widgets with the oscillators. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I could check if we have them in stock, but you  wouldn’t want them now, correct? Prospect: We need them ASAP and we can pay over invoice. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  38

## Page 39

Note - In this ignorant redirection I said, “I don’t know”. “I don’t know” is one  of the best redirections you can possibly use because instead of being the  answer man, you are now putting the pressure where it belongs, back on  the prospect.  People call me up about my mentoring program. They’ll say, Claude, tell  me about your mentoring program. Guess what my answer is?  I don’t know, Mr. Prospect. Which mentoring program are you talking  about? Which facet of my mentoring program - lease purchasing, Creative  Real Estate, sales training, coach training? I’m not sure if I understand your  question. Could you help me out a little, please?  Now you will notice, I redirected the question with the “I don’t know,” and  then I used a little bit of finesse. I said, “Could you help me please?”  There are so many ways that you can redirect and turn your prospect’s  questions into your questions. Redirecting in this manner allows you to  take control without the prospect ever seeing what you are doing, if you use  the correct finesse. You end up getting, rather than giving away information  and qualifying this prospect. Magic Lamp Technique This is the make-a-wish question: Prospect: We are just shopping around right now, but we have some questions about your widgets before we buy anything. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, let’s pretend for a moment, you  found a lamp and you had three wishes. What would you want to accomplish if you bought my product or service? What would be the things you  would like to do? Once again, you notice their question was turned into a different question.  They are going to give me more information. No matter which method you  use, always answer questions with questions. The ‘Multiple Choice Technique’ is another variation on this idea.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  39

G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mind if we discuss finances folks? What have you set  aside for a down payment in case we want to move ahead? Prospect: I don’t really know. I have to check our account, my wife, etc. G.U.T.S. Salesman: You could say, Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, would you be  more comfortable spending $1000, $5000 or $10,000? There are as many techniques in redirecting questions as the mind can  conceive. Can you think of some on your own right now? Why not make a  list of all the different ways you can ask questions - positive, negative,  open-close, multiple choice, “Magic Lamp” - think about all of the techniques I have mentioned and invent a few of your own.

G.U.T.S.™/Chutzpah Moves Part of the innovation of the G.U.T.S.™ Method is it’s G.U.T.S. MOVES.  These are the actions which you take that make meeker salespeople cringe  and shake in their *Birkenstocks™ or those goofy colorful plastic shoes  with the holes in them. Claude Note: *Really goofy looking German shoes that look as silly as the  recent colorful plastic sandals with the swiss cheese holes.

G.U.T.S. Moves allow you to be creative, stay in control, have fun, have  high self-esteem and of course, become very profitable. It’s Chutzpah to  the Max (not Max, the Mentor), but that is the price you are willing to pay  for success, right? Let’s discuss these special and strategic moves. Commitment Up-Front: The traditional sales dude talks and talks with no idea if he is going to make  enough for a cheese steak sandwich and a cold Rolling Rock Beer (it’s dinner time and I am hungry). Who said that we can’t get the most basic of  commitments from a prospect up-front, rather than squander so much time  buying lattes for someone who has no intention of doing any sort of business with us? Let’s check out a role play to demonstrate. Prospect: So can you deliver 12 gross of the green widgets? Typical Salesman: Sure we can, but the price goes up on Friday. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I can call my office right now and check, but before I  do, let’s assume that we have them in stock and can deliver them right  away, what would you like me to do? Prospect: I guess we would give you the order. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Do you Guess or Know? Prospect: I know, let’s go ahead. Money discussed Up-Front: For some reason, salesmen are reluctant to discuss financing, terms, payment, available funds or anything having to do with money in the initial conversation. Why, you ask? They are scared to death to discover that the  prospect cannot afford or is unwilling to spend the required amount to buy  their product or service. They hate losing a supposed prospect up-front  when they can delay the agony until a later time. It’s like putting off a visit to  the dentist rather than facing the music, (sorry dentists). The G.U.T.S.  Method salesmen, however, always want to discuss money ASAP because  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  42

## Page 43

it makes sense. Why spend time with someone who is incapable of affording your goods or unwilling to finance? Part of the millionaire concept is to  work smart and work fast. If it’s going to be over, does it make sense to do  it now or later after expending time and resources? It’s OK to fire an unproductive prospect. Heck, if the guy is broke, unwilling to finance, lies and/or  manipulates, then sack his butt. Life is too short to spend with unproductive prospects. Send them to your competition;-). G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, would you mind if we discussed price  and terms for a minute before we get to all of your specific questions? Prospect: I don’t mind, but I need information before I make a decision. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s no problem and I will be glad to answer all of  your questions. Let’s imagine for a minute, that my widgets are exactly  what you will need. Have you set aside funds to pay for them up-front or  will we need to discuss financing them? Prospect: Well, I will need to review my finances, discuss them with my  spouse, sleep on it, light a candle in church, check my Magic 8 Ball and  then get back to you. Typical Salesman: No need to talk about money, let me show you our brochures and answer all of your questions, buy you lunch, let you marry my  daughter and have my first born grandchild. I will do just about anything to  kid myself that I can do business with you. Editor Note: Yes, I know it’s sarcasm! G.U.T.S. Salesman: Well, why don’t you do all of that first and when you  have resolved the money issues we can go ahead. Here is my card. Call  me when you are ready. No Show and Tell:  I remember in early grade school, once a week, we would do show and tell.  Someone would bring in their Grandfather’s Civil War musket, tell about old  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  43

## Page 44

Gramps and how he fought off the Yankees and won the war (N.Y.C. Public  School Educational System). Today, we do the same thing in sales except it  is called a presentation or a Power Point display. In essence, it is the same  thing; a gratuitous dissemination of information except now we need to pay  bills and buy the kids shoes!  Editor note: If your kid is like mine, he outgrows his Nikes™ every full  moon! Typical salespeople love to give out free information, brochures, do research, consult, coach, even mentor with no thought of asking for a commitment in return. Heck, why rock the boat? It was enough trouble just to  get an appointment. Why take a chance of ticking the dude off by asking for  something in return. Claude Note: Later on in the manual, we will discuss why you absolutely  need a G.U.T.S. Marketing and Prospecting program to make your Sales  Method work. If you don’t have more prospects than you need, then you  are doomed to mitigate what you have learned and be subservient to the  prospect. Hi Mr. Prospect! Why yes, sure I will be glad to clean your company’s urinals before I give my presentation. Rule: You need to set up a plan where you have more potential prospects  than you need; more on this later. Prospect: Hi Leo, old buddy. We seem to have a problem with our widget  (from a competitor) dispenser. Do you have any idea how to get the thing  working? It’s costing us a fortune and my boss is all over me. Typical Salesman: No problem, Mr. Prospect. I can put our people right on  it and I will fly down to the factory today. Prospect: You’re a real pal, Leo. I can assure you that one of these days, you are going to get the highest priority and consideration for an order. Claude Note: Notice the ambiguity from the prospect. He hasn’t really  promised anything by the choice of words he has used. The typical salesHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  44

man lives in a fairy tale if he thinks this token commitment will result in  business. He will go back to his car thinking he has a potential future order,  but all he really has is bubkis! (A lot of nothing.) G.U.T.S. Salesman: Well Mr. Prospect, I sure am glad you thought of my  company. Let me ask you something first. What happened when you called  the technical support people from the (competitor’s) widget company? Prospect: Well, they are busy right now running their annual golf tournament and all of the tech people and salesmen are busy until next week. G.U.T.S. Salesman: They are known to be good people and I am sure this  isn’t something that will ever happen again. Prospect: Actually this has happened more than once. We have also had  quality control issues and once it took the salesman 10 days to get back to  me with an answer to a production question that I had. Come to think of it,  they have hung me out to dry more than once. Can you help me? My boss  is all over me about production costs with this problem. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I could probably have someone out to fix the dispenser  by this evening, but the service charge would be $5000.00. How would  your boss feel about that? Prospect: That’s Crazy! The other company does it for free. G.U.T.S. Salesman: You’re right, but they don’t seem to have any urgency  because of their golf outing. You know Mr. Prospect, that is a large sum, but  since you have never bought our product line, we need to be reimbursed  for our expenses. Can you suggest a way I can sell my superiors the idea  of waiving the 5K? Prospect: Suppose I promised to do business with you sometime in the future, could you get them to drop the service charge? G.U.T.S. Salesman: How about this, Mr. Prospect? Suppose I told my  company that you were willing to give me an order in writing today on the  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  45

## Page 46

next delivery of widgets and in return for giving us a chance to earn your  business, we would waive the service charge? Prospect: I could live with that, but are your prices competitive? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Yes, we are, but we do charge slightly more for a superior widget and we have the best service department in the business to enable you to avoid these service issues in the future. What would you like to  do today, Mr. Prospect? Prospect: If you can do the repair, I will give you a contract for my next order of widgets. G.U.T.S. Salesman: What about future monthly orders if we come through  as promised? Prospect: If you can save my butt and deliver the widgets as promised, we  can give you consistent business. G.U.T.S. Salesman: What about your existing supplier? Won’t they be upset and pressure you to keep ordering from them? Prospect: Like I said, if you can repair my system and deliver me a good  product you will be our supplier. Heck with those guys; let them play golf; I  got a business to run here. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, I know you are a man of your word and I  appreciate your commitment and thank you for your business. Now, let’s  put this in writing. Claude Note: Phew, I know this was a long role-play, but I presented you  with some ideas as to how you need to get commitments up-front and refrain from giving any free information until you have gotten enough facts. Is  it any wonder why I call this a G.U.T.S. Method? Did you notice that our  G.U.T.S. salesman did not do any show and tell until the very end?  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  46

## Page 47

Reject or fire the Prospect: You’ve heard me say this before, but it bears repeating. The guy who said  ‘the customer is always right’ either is an idiot or was never in sales. You  have rights in the sales process and one of those rights is to be treated as  respectfully as you treat the prospect. Unfortunately, that is not always the  case. Believe me when I first started out in sales, I ate a lot of Crow! In the beginning, while you learn your trade, gain insights and have both  positive and negative experiences, you may have to eat crow. Yes, I was  willing to pay my dues, but that doesn’t mean that I forget the less than respectful treatment I received from certain prospects. They wouldn’t treat  their own family, friends or neighbors the way they treat a salesperson and  maybe we are partially to blame. Today, now that I have G.U.T.S., it’s a different story. Darn, if I only knew then what I know today; Cie La Vie Mon  Ami. Mr. Prospect: Hi Joe, sorry to keep you waiting so long past our meeting  time (90 minutes). You know how busy we get. Just give me your best  prices and your latest brochure and I will get back to you. In fact, just give  me a call in a week or so. Typical Salesman: No problem sir, I understand how busy you are. Here is  the information you need and I will get back to you next week. Thank you  so much, sir. Claude note: This is the typical situation where a prospect has so little regard for the salesman because he has so little for himself. He would never  treat his doctor, lawyer or clergyman with the same disrespect. I remember  an old southern expression that goes like this, Don’t pee on my back and tell me it’s raining. Just remember, it’s OK to fire or reject the prospect. Unlike other sales methods, systems, books and seminars, I believe that sales  should be about you feeling great about yourself. As Max (my Mentor) used  to always say, Win Win is OK, as long as you win first.  Now see how the G.U.T.S. salesman handles the same situation. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  47

## Page 48

Prospect: Sorry about the long wait Claude, you know how it  is.....Yada-yada-yada. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Is there something wrong? Prospect: What do you mean? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Frankly Mr. Prospect, I am a little surprised. I am not  usually treated this way. If you didn’t want me to come to your office you  could have just said ‘no’. I am also very busy and I am surprised you  treated me this way. Is there something that we need to discuss or should I  just leave now because it is unlikely we will ever do business? Prospect: I am sorry, it’s been a crazy day and normally this would not have  occurred. It won’t happen again, I promise. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I understand. OK, let’s move forward then. You asked  me here because you have a problem and perhaps my company can resolve it. Mind if I ask you a few questions? Claude Note: If the prospect treats you less than professionally, it is usually your own fault. Remember, if you don’t feel great about your product,  service or yourself, than you had better make some fast changes. Yes, it’s  about you. Sales is about you first. It is my intent to give unbelievable service and  products with total accountability! (Yes, I do answer my own phone.) How  can I do that if I am coming from poverty, low self-esteem and subservience? (There, I said it.) Some may disagree with my philosophy, but if you  want to change the world, join the Peace Corps. If you want to protect and  provide for your family and live life as a decent human being, then be great  at sales. I remember one lady at a speaking engagement where I was invited to  speak. She said: Mr. Diamond, all you talk about is profit and lifestyle. I got  into sales to help my clients.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  48

There was a long dramatic silence and then I spoke. Ma’am, that’s the sickest thing I have ever heard! The audience laughed  and then I continued. Mother Theresa was a wonderful women who made  a difference for a few and inspired many, but it was Bill Gates of Microsoft  who enabled hundreds of thousands to provide for their family. Let’s be  honest and never confuse our priorities! As Stan Lee of Marvel Comics® used to say, Nuff Said! Ask the questions that need to be asked:  OK, it’s Chutzpah time. Sometimes you must ask the questions that need  to be asked even if it loses the sale or worse, it embarrasses you. Prospect: Tell me about your Program. Typical Salesman: Yada-yada-yada (30 minute BORING presentation!) G.U.T.S. Presentation: Which program, Mr. Prospect? Prospect: The one that deals with the Solar Powered Widgets. G.U.T.S. Presentation: Excellent, but why would your company be interested in Solar Powered Widgets? You have been using the standard Coal  Powered Widgets for over 20 years and I hear that they work great. Help  me out here so I can better understand. Prospect: The word came down from corporate that we need a more environmentally sound widget. In addition, we will get substantial tax credits if  we can make the change. G.U.T.S. Presentation: Well, that makes a great deal of sense. So why not  use your existing company ABC, for your widget needs? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  49

## Page 50

Prospect: Because they will not have a Solar Powered Widget ready for at  least 2 more years. G.U.T.S. Salesman: So why not wait 2 years and then make the change?  You have been using ABC for a long time. What harm can be done by waiting a little longer? Prospect: We need it now! Claude Note: Just keep asking questions with as much finesse as you can  muster and let the prospect do all of the work. Bottom line, you get the sale  and go out for a steak dinner and a good bottle of wine tonight! High Self-Esteem: If you don’t work at making yourself feel great about sales, then don’t expect anybody else to do it for you. You absolutely have to be your own  cheerleader. I love sales. One of the ten best feelings in the world is making a sale. (I think it’s number 3 or 4; don’t ask me about 1 and 2.)  The only way to have self-esteem is to succeed and the only way to measure success is to have financial success. Forget about pats on the back, titles and silly award dinners! Give me a nice big fat payday and I will feel  great! When lecturers discuss sales, they love to exclaim that sales is the  highest paid profession in the world. Fact: Sales is the highest paid profession for those who succeed, but for  many, sales is a way to barely make a living until you change to the next  job. What they don’t tell you is that professional sales also has the highest  turnover of any profession. Prospect: Why should I do business with you? Typical Salesman: We are the best, the biggest, the cheapest..... Yadayada-yada! HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  50

G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s a great question, Mr. Prospect. Maybe you  shouldn’t do business with me, but I am here for a reason; what is it? Obviously, if everything was working out all right, you wouldn’t have agreed to  this meeting. Tell me, how we can do business today? Prospect: What’s the difference between you and your competitor? G.U.T.S. Salesman: When you asked my competitor that question, what did  she reply? Prospect: We already have a supplier of widgets. I don’t need another supplier. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s fine, Mr. Prospect and I appreciate your being  up-front, but let me ask you one question before I leave. If there was one  thing your widget manufacturer could do better, what would it be? Remember: It’s not about the prospect, it’s about you!  Claude Note: This is probably a blasphemy in the annals of typical sales  training, but it’s still true. I know my competitors will get upset reading this,  but who cares! Chutzpah to the Max: The Nike commercial has always said it best: “Just do it!” Sometimes,  you just have to go for it. Let your instincts be your guide. Prospect: I didn’t come here to be insulted! Typical Salesman: I am sorry, Mr. Prospect. I didn’t mean to offend you, but  you did ask me for my honest opinion. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Where do you usually go, Mr. Prospect? ;-) Prospect: I am sick and tired of you peddlers! Typical Salesman: I’m so sorry, Mr. Prospect. How can I make it up to you? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  51

## Page 52

G.U.T.S. Salesman: You seem to be angry at me Mr. Prospect, for reasons  that I can’t comprehend. Tell me, did I make a pass at your wife at the last  holiday party or are you just having a bad day and maybe I should come  back another time? No Servitude:  My attitude in sales is, of course, to make a sale and profit, but I also want  to help the prospect solve a problem. We often hear that sales is a profession, yet few salespeople act professionally. We allow the prospect to treat  us as less than other professionals. Consider this, does your prospect  speak to you as they would their doctor, lawyer, Congressman?  Prospect: Get me your prices and I’ll get back to you later about the order. Typical Salesman: Sure, I can fax them to you by 6:00 this evening. G.U.T.S. Salesman: OK, but that will be $1000.00. Prospect: What! Your competition always gets me that information for free. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Sure, but if I am going to give you my prices to beat up  my competition, shouldn’t I get a commission? Get a dog, Harry: Sales is not about friendship, phony rapport and bonding. It is a professional business relationship. If delivering excellent products and services with accountability results in good business, so be it. If it  also creates respect and friendship, then you have a bonus. Never confuse  the reason as to why you are in business. If you want a friend, then get a dog!

The G.U.T.S.™ Success Staircase  3 Steps to Success Now we’re really going to get to the heart of the G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method©:  the Staircase of Success. I want you to take a plain sheet of paper and  draw a staircase. A vertical line, a horizontal line and three little steps.  That’s all you have to do. Leave yourself enough room because we are going to name each one of these steps. Within each of these three steps are  what we call the baby steps. We’ll go over the Staircase of Success and  then we’ll break it down into individual steps. Label the first step Agenda. The second step should be called Qualification, and the third step, Close. Now this may seem very simplistic at first,  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  53 CLOSE QUALIFICATION 7. The Success Staircase AGENDA The Heart of G.U.T.S. is its staircase. We use a staircase to rise to greater heights step-by-step. The staircase is  comprised of 3 basic steps-Agenda, Qualification and Close. Each step contains several substeps called Baby Steps.  Original Copyright Dec. 2005 All rights reserved www.ClaudeDiamond.com CC&R Property Investments, Inc. G.U.T.S.

## Page 54

but you’ll understand my methodology, the method of my madness, in a few  moments. Each step is going to be broken down into sub-steps or what I  call baby steps. The beauty of this method is that you are no longer having  to guess, you will have a plan. You always want to have a plan.  We will go step-by-step-by-step. That is how I got to the Staircase of Success. We’re not going to skip any steps. We’re always going to begin with  the Agenda, move to the Qualification and end with the Close. We’re not  going to jump from one step to another step because when we skip steps,  we tend to trip and fall, don’t we? This is a method that puts you in control. I came to this idea because I thought long and hard as to why people use  methods. I thought about Henry Ford and the invention of the assembly  line. It used to take a team of men working together days, to build a car.  Then Henry Ford had the idea to have people work on an assembly line,  essentially a railroad track, where each group would have a different responsibility. He discovered that by working on an assembly line, the length  of time required for these same people to build a car went from days to literally hours. Ford had found a better way to build a car. In terms of sales, instead of using tricky maneuvers, going from presentation to close to qualification and jumping all over the place, we have a  method. We’re going to have a lot of self-esteem in the process because  we’re in control. I can’t tell you how many times I went to sales presentations where I felt subservient, like a second or third class citizen. I was  swinging at baseballs with a blindfold on. I had no idea whether or not I  was going to make a sale. The prospect was the one in total control. With  the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©, we are now in control. We are going to have a  lot of fun with it. We are going to make a heck of a lot more money and  we’re going to feel good about ourselves.  Now, let’s hop onto the first step to sales success.  The G.U.T.S.™ Success Staircase HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  54

## Page 55

3 Steps to Success-The first Step  Agenda The first step in our ascending Staircase of Success is the Agenda Step.  The Agenda step is broken down into three baby steps. The first baby step  is Permission to ask Questions. The second baby step is Draw a Road  Map. The third baby step is It’s OK to Say 'No'. Now let’s go through  these three Agenda baby steps. Much has been written by other people in sales training about the necessity  for rapport and bonding between participants in a sales conversation. I disagree with this idea. I don’t think any prospect or any salesman should be  meeting with the intent to make friends. The purpose of doing business is  to complete the sale and to have a blank check in front of you for the rest of  your life. If a result of doing business honestly, being direct, forthright and  accountable results in respect and eventual friendship, consider that a  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  55 Road Map OK to Ask ?s Just say No! 7A. The Success Staircase AGENDA The first step is the Agenda and it is broken down into 3 Baby Steps. The Road Map is for telling  the prospect what is going to happen, to remove all anxiety. Next make sure that it's OK to ask ?'s.  Finally, remove all pressure by telling the prospect that they can just say NO as long as it's early in  the sales process. Original Copyright Dec. 2005 All rights reserved www.ClaudeDiamond.com CC&R Property Investments, Inc. G.U.T.S.

benefit of doing business correctly. Prospects know exactly what you’re  trying to do when you act like a typical salesman, so why waste your time  and theirs? Why not be up-front, straight-forward and honest with the  prospect, instead of trying to make a new best friend? Try to get some  trust going here. Let’s change the way the buyer and the seller react or  behave toward each other. Buyers have many preconceived notions about how the salesperson  should be acting. When you say the word “salesman” to most people,  they’re going to think: tricky, polyester suit, high pressure. People have  negative impressions about what a salesperson really is. The result is that  buyers feel they have to be defensive. They’re going to lie. They may say  that they’re ‘going to think about it’. They think you might be acting very  friendly towards them because you want to get some money from them. Of  course, you want to make the sale, but don’t you want to get it in a way that  allows you to gain the respect and the trust of the client? Wouldn’t you love  to have a relationship similar to that between a doctor and a patient, with  your prospect? That’s why I developed this Agenda Step and it begins with  a common courtesy; asking permission. The first baby step in the Agenda is Permission to Ask Questions. Have  you ever met a salesperson who said, Mr. Prospect, would you mind if I  asked you a few questions? Then I can see which way I can help you or  that maybe I can’t help you. Would that be a problem for you? Have you  ever met a salesperson who asked permission to ask questions? I’ve  never heard of anyone making that move unless I taught them. Typical  salesmen simply jump into their presentation. I think when you ask for  permission, you gain respect for being up-front and frank with the prospect.  I’ve never had anyone say “no” to me when I ask permission to ask questions.  In setting the Agenda, I’m setting up the way we are going to be doing  business. It’s like champion chess and I am now several moves ahead. The next baby step within the Agenda is Draw a Road Map. Many times,  as I said earlier, the buyer has preconceived notions. They’re wondering  what’s going on. They’re doing a lot of Kreskin style mind reading, trying to  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  56

## Page 57

figure out what the salesperson is up to. Why don’t we just eliminate that  and tell them what’s going to happen before it happens? We’re going to  draw a road map. Let me role-play and demonstrate what this will sound  like: G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, if you don’t mind, I’d like your permission  to ask you a few questions. Basically, why are we talking today? What’s  the purpose of this conversation? Why am I here? What would you like to  see happen? I’d like to find out what your needs are. I’d like to ask you  some questions about what you’re comfortable spending and how you  make commitments and decisions. Would that be all right? Now that’s the Road Map. I basically told the prospect what’s going to be  happening before it happens. There’s no second guessing. They don’t  have to worry about pressure or anything. I let him know that I am a professional and I will behave in a certain way. If he takes issue, then we need to  work it out or I have the choice to fire him up-front.  Going back to dentist stories, I got this idea from my dentist. I went to a  really good dentist whom I've been seeing for years in San Diego. I had a  tooth that had to be drilled and the dentist told me, Claude, I’ve got a swab  with some Ambesol that I’m going to use to swab the inside of your mouth.  Then I’m going to use this needle to inject some Novacaine into your  mouth. You won’t feel much pain or discomfort. Then I’m going to take a  drill to the tooth. He told me (without getting too morbid) about the whole  procedure and what he was going to do, before he did it. So there were no  surprises, no shocks. He instilled in me, a high level of trust. The same  thing should occur in sales. Draw a Road Map. Tell the prospect what’s  going to happen before it happens.  The third baby step of the Agenda is It’s OK to Say “No”. I don’t know  about you, but I have never met a salesperson who said, “Mr. Diamond, I’m  going to show you my product, I’m going to answer all of your questions. If  it’s not right for you and if you’re not comfortable with the product or service, if you don’t like the style, if it is not within the limits of what you wanted  to spend, it’s OK to say 'no' to me. Can you do that, Mr. Diamond? Can we  just be honest with each other?  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  57

## Page 58

I remove all the stress, all the pressure, from the sales process by giving  my prospects permission to say “no” to me, to be honest. Let me demonstrate what this might sound like, using the whole process of the Agenda. GU.T.S. Salesman: Miss Prospect, if it’s all right with you, I’d like to ask you  a few questions. What I basically want to find out is why we are talking today, what your needs are within your budget, what you are comfortable  spending and how you make decisions. At the end of our conversation,  you can ask me some questions and what I’d like us to do is to come to a  conclusion about whether we should go ahead and do business or not. If  you don’t feel my product or service is right for you or my house (if this is relating to real estate) is not right for you and you don’t want to move in, I  want you to feel comfortable enough to tell me that this is not the home  (product, etc.) for you. Can you do that, Miss Prospect? The answer is  usually, Sure. I can say 'no'.  Then I continue with, I hope you also can say 'yes' to me. I’d like to do  business with you. But I want you to know it’s OK to say 'no' to me and  there will be no issues. I don’t believe in pressuring people, but what I’d  like to know is that at the end of this conversation, you’ll either say 'yes' or  'no’, and you won’t say you’ll ‘think about it’ or ‘you’ll get back to me’. Normally people say that because they don’t want to hurt my feelings. I want  you to know up-front that you don’t have to worry about that. I’m here to  help you come to your own decision and your own conclusion. If you don’t  think this is right for you and you are not comfortable, you can say 'no' to  me. Is that all right with you? I challenge you, the reader of this book, have you ever heard any salesperson, in any situation - buying a car, life insurance, real estate or anything -  where the salesman told you that all of the usual games were unnecessary? This brings me back to my original premise: we have to stop the adversarial  relationships. We’re not out looking to make our new best friend with the  prospect, but we do want their respect and their trust.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  58

## Page 59

I know that when we go to a prospect and we tell them what’s going to  happen before it happens, when we ask permission to ask questions, when  we tell them ahead of time what kind of questions we’re going to ask and  we tell them it’s OK to do what is right for them by saying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ upfront, our conversation is generally a pleasant one. We are in control, we are acting like a professional and we gain trust. Isn’t  this a better way to do business? Isn’t this the way you want to do business?          HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  59

## Page 61

Qualification is broken down into four baby steps: · Needs & Greeds · Money/Finance · Time  · Commitment Needs and Greeds - This goes back to what we talked about earlier, discovery. That is to say, why people buy things, what is their desire and motivation to take an action, what is their interest level? Why are they talking  to us?  People buy things because they have to satisfy their needs and/or greeds.  If you are not asking yourself these questions then you really don’t understand my unique G.U.T.S. Sales Method. We are attempting not only to get  information, but an understanding, a psychological profile of our prospect.  We have to determine quickly, whether we can do business today or move  on until a better day. G.U.T.S. is about doing something you love, making  unbelievable profits, staying in control and feeling great about yourself. If  this is not what you believe in, then study the other guy’s old fashioned dog  and pony show system.  Claude Note: Yes, I am passionate about sales and truly believe that sales  is the million dollar skill. Max used to say that everyone wants to be rich,  but few are willing to pay the price. Are their needs strong and passionate or are they very weak and intellectual? We need to rate the information we have retrieved. Imagine a scale  from one to ten. This is our G.U.T.S. Barometer. 1 thru 3 - indicates low needs 4 thru 7 - some needs and interest  8 thru 10 - high needs, desire to profit, passionate, a sense of urgency People buy things because they become emotional about them. Let’s take  an example of someone we talk to who says, I’m just looking. I just want to  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  61

## Page 62

gather some information and kind of mull it over. That’s someone who has  really weak needs, a 1 to 3 on the scale. We might refer to that prospect  as having the paralysis of analysis. Some people might refer to them as  tire kickers or time-wasters. Their needs are not very strong right now. A 4 thru 7 on our G.U.T.S. barometer might be someone who has a higher  level of needs and many questions. They are close, but no cigar for you  yet. I’m very interested and have some needs. I want more information to  feel comfortable. A prospect who is an 8, 9 or 10 is ready to make a move because of urgent  desires, needs or greeds. I am ready to make a decision. I have to do  something as soon as possible. Can you help me now? What do I need to  do? Money is no object for the immediate results I need. A good example  would be someone whose car breaks down in a bad neighborhood and it’s  getting to be dark. Are their needs strong? Do they need a tow truck now?  The second baby step is an important one. It is Money/Finance. As I said  earlier, money is the subject we have to talk about very early on in the  process. Most sales people are afraid to talk about money in the beginning; they want to talk about it at the end. They are too scared; they’re  worried about getting some kind of rejection. We have to talk about the  money up-front and we have to stick to our redirection, our questions.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, do you mind if we discuss money and finances and if I ask you a few questions? Prospect: Sure, go ahead. G.U.T.S. Salesman: If I have a home for you in my inventory, how much  money do you have in terms of cash and credit that you can commit to your  future home? Prospect: I think I can commit $15,000.00. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Think or know? Prospect: I know. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  62

## Page 63

G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you and what kind of money per month are you  comfortable spending on rent? Prospect: $1800.00.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: If I can find a home that you like which conforms with  these numbers, what would you like to do? Prospect: Let’s do it! Some people play their cards, like in the game of poker, very close to their  chests. They might not want to give away that information readily. You  have to keep redirecting. You have to keep asking questions, with finesse.  Remember, questions can seem aggressive, abrasive and very arrogant.  So be careful how you ask your questions. Time is our next subset in the qualification step and we have to determine  if the prospect is ready to take an action now because of some motivation. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Ms. Prospect, you’re not looking to buy a car today are  you? Prospect: Correct, I will not be able to buy a car until I pay off my current  loan and that might take another six months. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Thank you for sharing that information. Last question  before I go; suppose I was able to pay off your existing loan and get you  into a new car today. You wouldn’t be comfortable with that would you? Prospect: That would be great! How would we do that? G.U.T.S. Salesman: Let me explain and then show you. If you are comfortable and we can agree on terms what would you like to do? Prospect: I’d say, let’s do it! Commitment is our final step in qualification where you get an idea if the  prospect is serious and capable of moving forward (to the Close Step), unHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  63

der the right circumstances or you should end the conversation or fire the  prospect at this point and move on to the next prospect. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, if I understand you correctly, you need a  widget in blue and red for a new project that you are working on. If we can  provide those widgets that meet with your needs and within your financial  constraints what would be our next move? Prospect: Well, I still have many questions and want to see a sample of  your widgets. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s fair. I just want to make sure that we are on the  same train here and that there is a likelihood that you and I can do some  business today. Prospect: Looks good at this point. I’m not there yet, but I am close to making a purchasing decision. G.U.T.S. Salesman: That’s fine, Mr. Prospect. I want your business, but if  my product is not in your best interest, it is still OK for you to be up-front  with me, OK? Prospect: I like your up-front approach. OK.    HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  64

The G.U.T.S.™ Success Staircase  3 Steps to Success-The Third Step  The Close  The third and final step of the G.U.T.S. Sales Method© is the Close. This is  where we get to finally make our presentation and get paid. The close is  broken down into four baby steps. These Steps are: · The Review · Satisfy or Satisfaction · Ask the Question · Triple C HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  65 Road Map OK to Ask ?s Just say No! Needs & Greeds Money Time Commitment Miscellaneous Review Satisfy Close Change Confirm CCC CLOSE The last step in our staircase is the close which is comprised of 3 baby steps.

You move on to how your product/service will satisfy the needs/greeds of your prospect.Your  final baby step in the close is the CCC.

## Page 66

The Review is basically where we review the discovery information accomplished through the Agenda and Qualification steps. It’s where we go  over and summarize what we’ve agreed upon and what we’ve learned from  our question-based method. This will sound something like:  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Ms. Prospect, thank you for allowing me to ask you  these questions. As I said, if my product can help you, that’s wonderful. If it  can’t, you are free to say 'no'. From our discussion, I have learned you  have been renting for ten years and you’ve spent thousands of dollars making your landlord rich. You want to move as soon as possible because you  want to get into a home of your own. You want security, you want tax  benefits and you’d like a nice quiet place in a good school district for your  children. You also told me that you want to do this as soon as possible,  that you have a $10,000 budget for a deposit, you can afford $1500/month  rent and that you are the sole decision maker in this entire process. Is that  basically a good summarization of what we’ve discussed, Ms. Prospect? So you see we’re going over, we’re reviewing everything they’ve said.  We’re using the information they gave us, based on our questions, our redirection, and we’re keeping everything in the forefront. We’re trying to keep  the needs of the prospect strong, to maintain a sense of urgency. We want  to keep the prospect emotional, because we know that people buy things  because of that urgency, that need.  The next baby step in our Close Step is what we call the Satisfaction.  The Satisfaction is essentially where we finally, (believe it or not), we finally get to tell our story aka: The Presentation. Unlike the traditional  salesperson, we do not give away our information until the very end.  The logical reason is, how can we give a presentation if we don’t know  what to present and to whom to present it to? If we don’t know what the  needs of the prospect are, we have multiple products and services, specifically in Creative Real Estate, we don’t want to talk to someone about a million dollar home when they have a small condo budget. Right?  So we don’t give an overly broad presentation, we wait until we know what  we should be talking about. Then we can satisfy the prospect’s needs.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  66

## Page 67

We use all of the information they gave us to relate our product, service, or  our real estate to their needs, whether they are a buyer or a seller. We wait  and show patience until we are ready to make our move under our terms. It might sound something like this: G.U.T.S. Salesman: Miss Prospect, you told me why you are looking for a  home and what your budget is. We have a property in the neighborhood  you are looking at. It is $10,000 down and $1,200/month. It is a rent-to  -own and you can move into it in the next 30 days. I think this will solve  your problem. It will give you the opportunity to plan so you can save to  correct your credit. Then you can buy the house anytime within the next  two years. That’s why I've been asking you all these questions about the  rent-to-own. What I basically did in this second baby step is to try to satisfy all of the information; the needs of the prospect. That’s why we call it the Satisfaction. You can call it a presentation or whatever you like, but we now know  how to direct our product, service or real estate towards the qualification of  the prospect. You can see how this is a much stronger method than faking  it and giving overly broad presentations or free consultations. After we’ve  asked the right questions, we can direct our real estate towards this prospect in exactly the way they’ve explained it to us. At this point we are going to move to the third baby step within the Close Step. This is the only traditional close strategy you’ll get from me. It’s  called Ask the Question. The last question sounds something like this: G.U.T.S. Salesman: Miss Prospect, we’ve talked about what you’re looking  for. We talked about a property I have that I think will fulfill your need. What  would you like to do next?  Hopefully, at this point, you have a high assurance or confidence level that  the prospect is going to say “yes” because you’ve taken them step-by-step.  You are going to use their own words from the information that they  gave you to move them to a close or to a stronger commitment. Only  then are you going to ask one simple question. You’re not going to sound  like the typical salesperson who keeps asking for the order in different obHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  67

## Page 68

vious tacky and cheesy ways. You are just going to go to the prospect and  say, This is what you said you’re looking for. This is what I have. What  would you like to do next?  So you see, we only ask one question and if we do this the right way, we  have a very high likelihood that we’re going to get the order right now. A  big psychological difference here is that we’re not asking for the order. We  are asking the prospect to make the decision to give us the order.  Done in this manner, they don’t feel pressured or manipulated because the  prospect made the decision. We led them down the path by taking an interest in them. If they say ‘no’ or they are not ready, you can either review  their needs and provide some discomfort, otherwise you have my permission to Fire Them and move on to the next prospect. Believe me, this  method is much better than driving yourself crazy with an unproductive  prospect. Claude Note: I remember one prospect who was playing games with me  during the Qualification Step. I was starting to feel annoyed with his games  so I fired the fool.  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. Prospect, I feel that you and I are not a good fit  and it wouldn’t make sense for us to work together. I have decided that I  will not be working with you, but I wish you well. Prospect: Hold on, I still have questions. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I understand and I will be glad to email you my competition’s phone number and perhaps they will be willing to answer your questions. At this time, however, I have many other clients and prospects who I  need to speak with. Have a great day. Bye. Claude Note: The next day this same prospect called me back, apologized  and paid me in full. It seems that he had never met a G.U.T.S. Method  Salesman. Remember, we don’t have to prostrate ourselves like the traditional old fashioned salesman. Why do you think he called me back? Once again, we’re back to the doctor/patient relationship. When you go to  see a doctor, they don’t sound like a salesperson. They ask questions.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  68

## Page 69

They do a diagnosis. They want to find out where you’re hurting, why  you’re hurting, when you began hurting. The patient would not go to the  doctor and say, I want to read your literature and then proceed to ask a lot  of silly questions. Why? There is a certain respect understood in that type  of relationship. I want you to create that same respect by asking questions  just like your doctor would. The prospect then sees you as someone who  is professional and truly has an interest. That’s why we ask questions.  Hopefully, we’ve received the order after we’ve asked the last question and  then we can move to the final step,  The Triple C – Confirm, Change and Final Close. To Confirm an order,  we go to the prospects and say,  Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, are you comfortable with this decision? Are you all  right with it? You’re not going to call me tomorrow and tell me that you’ve  changed your mind or anything? Most salespeople, once they get an order,  get very excited. They jump up and down, take the check and run out of  the place, only to find that the next day the prospect had some kind of remorse. This has happened to me many times in Creative Real Estate because I ran too fast and I didn’t tie up the loose ends. I want you, in the  Triple C process, to first Confirm the sale. For example:  G.U.T.S. Salesman: Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, I am glad that we will be doing  business together and that you’re comfortable with this decision. I know  that you are people who take commitments seriously. You’re not going to  call me tomorrow and tell me that you changed your mind, are you? Prospect: No, once we make up our minds, that’s it. You have my word! If you can do this one little Step, you will never get a prospect calling you  the next day with any kind of remorse. You’ve taken care of potential problems up-front. The second step of the Triple C is Change. Sometimes you have to modify, change or re-negotiate steps. The prospect may say something like, I’m  not comfortable putting $10,000 down. Is there any way we can finance it? This is where you would ask the prospect another question such as, If we  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  69

## Page 70

could finance it, what would you say to us next? Or If we could finance it,  what would you be comfortable putting down? You’re going to change,  you’re going to modify, you’re going to re-negotiate in this part of the Triple  C. That’s why we call it the Change. You’ve got the sale. You’ve got to  fine tune it a little bit here. You’ve got to fix some things. This can happen  in any sales situation, especially a great deal in Creative Real Estate.  Prospect: Oh, I have one last question, Claude. Could we change our delivery date from Monday to Friday at 10 AM? It would be a better time for  me. G.U.T.S. Salesman: I will have to move a few things around and change  some other appointments, but I will make a great effort to accommodate  you, Mr. Prospect. Prospect: Thank you, Claude. Sorry if I inconvenienced you. Claude Note: Always make them pay and keep the control. Never give  away an item of negotiation without getting something in return. (G.U.T.S.  Negotiation.) The last step of the baby Steps is the Final Close. That’s where you just  go to the prospect, thank them for the order, reconfirm the order, get the  order or agreement signed and get the credit/debit card or check payment,  deposit, etc., if required. Then you’re done for the day. Go home or hang up  the phone and celebrate. Claude Note: I always like to celebrate when a big sale or target goal has  been met. It’s a way to reward myself for accepting and conquering challenges. It can be as simple as a nice dinner out or as elaborate as a new  car. Excuse me, Mr. Salesman, does that 2 door Cadillac come in baby blue?   HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  70

Claude Note: You will never feel subservient to a prospect if you know that  there are plenty more waiting for you. How many salespeople treat the  prospect with kid gloves just because they have no one else to speak with? The G.U.T.S. Prospecting Philosophy is simply to use The Laws of Attraction combined with consistent Virile Marketing to keep: 1. The Phone Ringing. 2. Emails coming in everyday in large quantities with complete contact information (name, postal address, telephone numbers and a comment/ question section). 3. Prospects in large numbers going to your web pages, blogs and numerous links, reading your information and wanting more. I espouse a very practical sales technique that has been practiced by the  wealthiest salespeople in the world and it’s called talking to people. Talking to people essentially means what it says; it’s about answering  you own business phone and getting back to people who have contacted you.  If you can create multiple modern marketing methods, you will have more  people than necessary to speak with everyday. My business, for example, is about several niche areas:  • Lease Purchase Creative Real Estate • G.U.T.S. Sales Training • One-on-One Success Mentoring (The Millionaire Mindset) We normally receive 100 and more communications from prospects every  day. How do we do it? We put the G.U.T.S. Prospecting System to work.  We begin with the most powerful word in the English language and it called  “FREE”! In order to break the barriers of the prospect and create trust and  curiosity from nothing, you have to create interest. In the old days, I would run very expensive ads in national newspapers and  magazines with my 800 number. The ad would read “Discover the Lease  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  72

## Page 73

Purchase Advantage” Free Newsletter, call (800) 324-4652. The phone  would ring, we would answer it, capture the mailing address and phone  number and then send a newsletter. Every couple of months we produced  a new newsletter. We also did public speaking at seminars and real estate  clubs. The Internet came along and everything changed very quickly with the advent of email, web pages, newsgroups, blogs, instant messenger and FTP  (file transfer protocol). Emails are much faster than the postal service and  the web could be searched instantly for information. The big advantage  was that there was access to a much larger group of people. We were no  longer limited and marketing became international. OK, you didn’t come  here for a history lesson on the World Wide Web, but it’s important to know  how everything changed after the web became practical for the masses! We now have several dedicated web pages and blogs with tons of free information. Anyone who uses a search engine and types in my name or  keywords that relate to what I mentor in, like Success Training, Lease Purchasing, G.U.T.S. Sales Training are led to a short description of what we  offer on Google or Yahoo. When these links are clicked on, the reader goes  straight to my web page, where they see that wonderful word I spoke about  earlier “FREE”! We Offer Free Newsletters: with tons of contemporary and entertaining stories and  information. Free Audio CDs: describing our concepts, ideas and programs Free E-Books: excerpts from several of my books Free Podcasts: audio files which can be played on the Apple iPods Free links to Blogs: informational Web pages We are basically laying out a lure, just as a good fisherman would do. What  does the interested party have to do to get all of this? Just register their  name, address, phone number and email. This is where the G.U.T.S. machine goes into hyper-drive. After the prospect fills out the information, the  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  73

## Page 74

auto-responder sends them an immediate link to free ebooks and other  links connecting to our websites. When the email arrives into our browser, it  also responds immediately and sends an email with more information. The  data we receive is then placed into our computer database for future correspondence and notes. Subsequently, a copy of our newsletter is then mailed first class with a  cover letter, business card and a free audio CD set valued at $199.00. It’s  also Hand Addressed. Why? Because the response rate exponentially increases. The prospect is personally called within 24 hours after the email is  received. The G.U.T.S. Marketing Method has now been implemented. Claude Note: Sooner is better in G.U.T.S. Marketing. Here’s an example: G.U.T.S. Salesman (on the phone): Hello Mr. Prospect, this is Claude Diamond. I received a message today that you contacted our company for information and I am getting back to you. How can I help you today? Prospect: I would like to know more about your Lease Purchase Program. G.U.T.S. Salesman: Some of our information has been sent to you in the  mail and you should have also received an email with some free ebooks,  too. Maybe you could tell me why you are interested in Lease Purchasing.  Also, do you mind if I ask you a few questions? This is a simple role play, but it demonstrates how you can use G.U.T.S. to  create prospects who want your information and then you have the opportunity for speaking directly with potential clients. The G.U.T.S. Prospecting Plan employs other methods like public speaking, sponsored ads on Google, links, blogs, referrals, as well as tons of  freebies like CDs, DVDs, ebooks, Podcasts and anything that brings the  prospects to you and adds to your contact database.  It is essential that you have plenty of calls to make or receive everyday, if  you are going to make G.U.T.S. work. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  74

CD Claude Note: Hello, this is Claude “The Mentor” Diamond and I’d like to  talk to you about my G.U.T.S.™ Selling Method and particularly how it applies to Creative Real Estate and my personal favorite, lease purchasing.  The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method could apply to any business with a sales or  service or for someone who wants to work smart and go to the bank. I’m in  Creative Real Estate and I mentor people in business. I also do sales training, coaching and consulting. I had a big problem. I was a good student  and went to a lot of seminars and yes, I bought a lot of books and tapes.  The problem I encountered was that I was working hard, but I wasn’t making a lot of money. I knew my stuff and I studied hard, but I found that  many people were frankly, just wasting my time. Particularly, in Creative  Real Estate, people would often call me and try to pick my brains. I would  end up being a free consultant, giving away a lot of gratis information in areas that I had studied for years and years. I paid the price, but I wouldn’t  make any money from it. Often, I’d go to properties, meet the owner of the  property or I’d meet some prospective tenants there and we would look at  the house. I’d show them around and at the end, I’d ask for the order and  they’d say things like “I’ll think about it” or “I’ll get back to you.” I was just  doing a lot of busy work, but I found that it just wasn’t being as productive  and profitable as I’d like it to be. I really wanted to make a lot of money, heck who doesn’t? My business  now generates a very high, 7-figure lifestyle for my family and I attribute  this to using this G.U.T.S.™ Selling Method. We all have 24 hours in a day.  We’re all in the same intelligence quotient range. Why do some people  make as much money as they want and others just keep struggling and  struggling and go further and further into debt? We’re probably all using  good products and services, generally. It’s that we’re not working as smart  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  75

as we could. We’re not working in a methodic way, particularly in sales,  marketing and prospecting.  I want to give you an idea of how to work smarter and how you can apply  this to anyone else’s method. There are a lot of good people with great information concerning: Nothing down on ugly properties Subject to transactions Lease purchasing (my favorite) Fixers Foreclosures Notes and more There are so many different ways to do Creative Real Estate. The problem  is we get all this information and we do all this running around, but we don’t  make as much money as we want. We end up just giving away free information. What happens to many of us is that we become frustrated. We all  know that feeling, right? We work really hard and before we know it, it’s  Friday. We’re emotionally drained and guess what? We didn’t go to the  bank. We didn’t make money even though we were highly motivated and  had the best intentions.  It finally dawned on me, that I was working as hard as anyone in Creative  Real Estate when I first started, but I wasn’t working smart. I wasn’t qualifying properly. I believe that we have rights in the sales process. One of  the key rules I want to teach you is that you have the right to qualify your  prospects; whether they’re the buyer, the seller, an investor or another  professional you are working with. You have to get the information rather  than give the information. If you take my principles of the G.U.T.S.™ Selling Method and apply them  to your Creative Real Estate business or any business that you are working  with, you will see spectacular results. You will be having fun. Your selfesteem will go up. You’ll be working smarter. You’ll be happier. Of course,  you will be much more profitable. There is only one problem with my  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  76

method. It’s kind of different than what you’ve heard or learned before.  You’re not going to give presentations. You’re not going to ask for the order  20 times in a conversation with a prospect. You’re not even going to a  property or meet with a tenant-buyer until you know for sure you’re going to  pick up a check or a contract. You’re going to learn to work smart in this  specific step-by-step method. In fact, I use the word “step” on purpose because this is the Staircase of Success.  The question a lot of people ask me is, Claude, why a method? I’ve studied all the greats out there - Dale Carnegie, Brian Tracy, Zig Ziegler - all  great people with great ideas about sales. The problem is that a lot of this  information has been around for so long that your prospects know what you  are going to do before you do it. They know that you’re going to try to corner them and pressure them. They know that you’re going to ask for the  order several times. So we can’t just go out there in a disorganized fashion  and give away a lot of information. We’ve got to stop the presentation mentality that we have. We have to stop the adversarial relationship between  the buyer and the seller.  What we want to do is create an air of trust and of understanding with an  up-front commitment between both parties. Imagine, if you had a salesman  come up to you and say, Mr. Prospect, I’d like to help you make a decision.  I’m going to give you as much information as you need, but before I do that  I’d like to ask you a few questions and see how we can work together. At  the end of this conversation, you ask me a few questions, too. I don’t believe in pressuring you. I’d like you to be comfortable enough to be able to  say 'no' to me. If you don’t like my product, my service, the cost of it, anything including me, it’s OK to say 'no' to me. Now, have you ever met a salesperson who says something like that?  Well, if you are like me, you probably haven’t heard anything like this. We  want to change, we want to stop the adversarial relationship between the  buyer and seller and create an air of trust. We also want to have control of  the entire process. So I developed a question-based selling method based  on the results I had when I started to change the way I operated. I found  that a method is much better than just going out and giving away a lot of  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  77

free information. I work in a 3-step fashion with the G.U.T.S. Selling  Method. I call it G.U.T.S. because it does take a little bit of spine to ask  some of the questions we are going to ask. Most people in sales, for instance, never want to talk about money in the beginning of the sales process. They are too worried about getting rejected and blowing the whole  prospective sale. So when do most sales people talk about money? They  talk about it at the end.  I’ve been involved in real estate and lease purchasing for quite awhile. I  love Creative Real Estate and work very hard at it, but I also wasted an awful lot of time. I’d get in my car and drive to the property with the buyer or  seller. We’d look at the home. We’ve have endless phone conversations.  I’d send literature and at the end of all this time invested, guess what a lot  of people said to me? Claude, looks like a great deal, but we don’t have  the money right now. We’ll have to do it some other time.  My heart just broke, but thanks to Max, my mentor, I learned that it was my  responsibility to qualify for money at the very beginning of any sales process. Once again, we have to learn to work smart. We have to ask the  touchy, sensitive and uncomfortable questions. We want to talk about the  money up-front. We never want to ask for the order. We want the prospect  to make their own decision and basically give us the order because it  makes sense for them. There are lots of rules in this G.U.T.S. Selling Method. Some of them will  be contradictory or just plain opposite what you have learned from other  sales training courses, books and CDs. This G.U.T.S. Sales Method is  based on getting to the bottom line, working smart, gaining trust and being  OK with the word 'no'. If fact, we learn to love the word 'no'. The word 'no'  means it’s over and we stop wasting time. I would rather hear the word 'no'  up-front in the first 3-5 minutes instead of investing hours, days, weeks or  months with a transaction! The bottom line is to get the 'no' up-front and  talk to the people who want to do deals. This is part of the ‘work smart concept’ in the G.U.T.S. Selling Method. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  78

## Page 79

I’m getting a little ahead of myself. First, I want to talk about why people  buy our products and services. What’s the motivating factor? Why do people do the things that they do? They do things because of needs. Their  needs can be very strong and they can even be emotional.  I like to talk about the analogy of the dentist. Nobody really wants to go to  the dentist, but in many cases we have to go. Imagine if you had a toothache on Christmas morning. There was nobody open and this toothache  was really killing you. You went through the phonebook and you called  dentist after dentist. You finally got one on the phone and that dentist said  to you, Sure, I’ll open my office and I’ll take care of that tooth, but I’ll have  to charge you cash up-front. I won’t take your Blue Cross or HMO card.  Are you really going to argue with that dentist if you’re truly in agony? Of  course not. Are you going to negotiate? Are you going to ask for literature,  for references? Are you going to say you’ll think about it? Of course not.  You’re going to go to that dentist’s office. You’re going to write him a check  for whatever he asks because you are ready to buy. It’s not a decision  making process here. You’re in great need. People buy things because of  needs. People do not buy things because of fancy advertising and high  pressure salespeople. People buy things because they become emotional  about them. Once we understand why people truly buy things, then we can  direct the conversation with our G.U.T.S. Selling Method so that we have  an understanding of why they are buying. If we can’t understand why they  are buying, we can’t create some needs for these people.  Prospects are not going to do Creative Real Estate deals with us because  we have fancy literature or because we have this very expensive advertising campaign. The typical tenant-buyer is going to buy a home because: • they’re tired of paying rent or • their neighbors are noisy or • they want appreciation or • they want greater security or • they want equity or • they want tax benefits. • The reasons are countless. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  79

## Page 80

They are not going to do real estate with you because they woke up one  day and said, Gee whiz, I want to go out and do a lease purchase or a subject to or a wrap-around type deal. They are going to do it because they  have some kind of motivation which usually is financial. Now, is that need  academic or is that need emotional? It’s your job to find out. If someone is  not ready to buy, let’s qualify them very quickly and get off the phone with  them as fast as possible. If their needs are great, they are emotional about  these needs, they are going to take an action and do business with us.  That’s why people buy things. They want to avoid the problems they’ve  been having; either existing or future problems and needs. Now I’m going to go over a few of the rules of the G.U.T.S. Selling Method.  One of our most basic rules is: Never give away free information. That’s  right. Never give a Power Point presentation or consultation until you have  completely qualified the prospect. You want to know: • if they want to buy something • if they have some needs • if they have the money to buy those needs on a timely basis • that they are ready to make a commitment • that they can make a decision or they’re part of the decision making       process Never give away your hard earned knowledge and experiences until you’ve  properly qualified the individual!  Another rule: No more begging! That’s what your traditional salespeople  do. They ask for the order. I don’t want you asking for the order. I want the  prospect to come to their own logical conclusion, their own decision.  They’ll give you the order. They’ll give you the sale because they came to  the decision. Remember everyone loves to buy, but no one wants to be  sold. People are really tired of the traditional old fashioned salesperson  who does a lot of tricky maneuvering, all the obvious closes and things like  that. They want to buy if their needs are great enough and if you’ve qualified them properly.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  80

## Page 81

Let the prospect give you the order. You are going to help lead them  down the road so that they come to their own natural conclusion. If they  don’t buy from you because they don’t have the need, the money, the timeliness or it’s not within their commitment process, it’s OK, because it’s over.  And it’s over quickly – in the first couple of minutes with the G.U.T.S. Selling Method.  Now that we know some of the rules and ideology of the G.U.T.S. Selling  Method we want to move up the Staircase of Success. How do we get the  information? How do we qualify people? How do we determine if we have  a prospect or a time-wasting tire kicker? The strategy that really makes the whole thing work is learning how to ask  questions. This is a question-based selling method. We have rights in  the process, as I said earlier. We have the right to get information. Questions, however, by their very nature after a while, become aggravating and  annoying. Nobody wants to be constantly pummeled with a lot of questions  from a salesperson who is trying to pry. We have to ask questions in a certain way.   Questions are the means for us to propel ourselves up the Staircase of  Success, step-by-step-by-step. They allow us to get the information we  need. We have rights in this sales process. Unlike our sales counterparts,  we are not just going to go ahead and give a presentation. We are going to  ask questions, but there is a certain way we ask questions. I like to call this  “with finesse”.  We ask questions in a certain way. We’re going to talk to people and formulate our questions so they are not harsh or adversarial. An example of  this would be when our prospect asks us a question like, How long can we  rent this property? The average salesperson in Creative Real Estate would  say, One or two years or whatever the term would be. The G.U.T.S.  Salesman would turn the question around. We call this redirecting. We  direct questions that are asked of us into our own questions so that we get  information. If the tenant-buyer asks us, how long can I rent this property?  You might say something like, that’s an excellent question, Mr. Prospect.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  81

## Page 82

Now could you just help me out? You must have asked that for a reason. You see the way I did it - with finesse - it hardly seems that I turned the  prospect’s question into my question thereby getting out of having to answer questions and getting more information from the prospect. The prospect might reply, I need a property for at least 2 years because that’s how  long my company requires me to stay in the area. So now you’ve gotten  some more information just because you redirected the question with finesse. You turned it around. Here’s another example: Suppose someone asks you for the price. The  prospect might ask, How much is this house? How much are you selling it  for? You might say something like, It really depends, Mr. Prospect. Could  you give me an idea of what your budget is? What you’re looking to  spend? How much money do you have set aside for this? Maybe I could  work with you. Could you give me an idea please? I never answered the  question. I redirected it with finesse. I’m trying to get the prospect to give  us more information. Mr. Herb Cohen, who wrote the wonderful book, How to Negotiate Everything said, “the first to mention price always loses”. If  you are asked a money question, you want to redirect it or turn it around.  Just like I did in the previous example, with finesse, so that the prospect  gives me more information. Remember, whenever you’re asked a question or whenever you are asking  a question or answering one, turn it into another question and use finesse.  Tie in a compliment before you ask another question. If someone asks you,  How much is the rent? You don’t want to just say, That’s a good question,  why did you ask that? That’s too abrasive. Turn your questions around  and smooth them over with the finesse concept. As you can see, in this method (this is a question-based Socratic method),  questions are very important to make the method work. There are different  kinds of questions we can ask. I went to law school and I came to this conclusion because in law school they teach with a method called Socratic  teaching. Socrates, the ancient philosopher, believed that the best way he  could teach his students was by turning their questions into his questions.  He wanted to make them think. He wanted them to arrive at their own anHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  82

## Page 83

swers. We do the same thing in the G.U.T.S. Selling Method. We have to  ask questions in different ways. One of the best ways to answer a question  is to redirect the question in a positive or negative tone. Someone might  say to you, What is a lease purchase? How does that work? You might respond with, Why are you interested in that, Mr. Prospect? I thought you  were looking to buy a home. That isn’t anything you’d want to do, is it? You notice how I put a negative tone to my redirection. This is the way we  want to answer questions to make the prospect go in the direction we want  to lead them. Sometimes, going negative or positive, can get you the answer or help the prospect come to their own conclusions. I have a lot of people who call me and ask, What’s the difference between  you and some other guru or trainer out there? I might respond, That’s a  good question, Mr. Prospect. He is a very good trainer and if you’ve already researched him, why not just go with him? Now you noticed, I went  very very positive. My competition, in many cases, go negative when  asked about the competition. I always go positive. You know why? The  prospect’s answer will usually explain to me why they didn’t do business.  So when I tell a potential client, He’s a good trainer and if you’ve investigated him, why don’t you just do business with him? They might say, He  was too expensive. I didn’t like the program. It didn’t address my goals.  Now I’m getting more information just by redirecting the question in a positive or negative way. I’m getting more information in order to determine  how I can do business with this prospect. So remember, redirection can be  positive or negative. Go in the opposite direction that your prospect expects you to go in. Essentially, do the opposite of the traditional sales  person. Another question technique is what I call the “ignorant redirection”.  That’s where someone might ask us a question like, How much money will  I need to put down in order to do this deal with you? I might answer, I don’t  know, Mr. Prospect, that’s a good question could you help me out? What were you looking to spend? Do you have a budget set aside? Is there  something you are comfortable spending right now? Did you notice in that  ignorant redirection I said “I don’t know.” “I don’t know” is one of the best  redirections you can possibly use because instead of making you the anHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  83

swer man, you are now putting the pressure where it belongs, back on the  prospect.  I get people who call me about my mentoring program. They’ll say, Claude,  tell me about your mentoring program. Guess what my answer is? I don’t  know, Mr. Prospect. Which mentoring program are you talking about?  Which facet of my mentoring program - lease purchasing, creative real estate, sales training, coach training? I’m not sure if I understand your question. Could you help me out a little please? Now if you notice, I redirected  the question with the “I don’t know” and then I used a little bit of finesse. I  said, Could you help me please?  There are so many ways that you can redirect and turn your prospects’  questions into your questions. It alleviates you from giving away free information and it allows you to take control without the prospect ever seeing  what you are doing, if you use the correct finesse. You end up getting information and qualifying this prospect. One of the other question-based techniques I like to use is the “Magic  Lamp Technique”. It’s where I’ll go to a prospect and say, Mr. and Mrs.  Prospect, let’s pretend for a moment that you found a lamp and you had 3  wishes. What would you want to accomplish if you bought my product or  service. What would be the things you would like to do? Now you notice their question was turned into a question. They are going  to give me more information. No matter what method you use, you always  want to answer questions with questions. Another strategic question is what I call the “Multiple Choice Technique”.  This is where you might go to a prospect and say, What is your budget?  and they respond, I don’t really know or I don’t want to talk about it. You  come back to them with a multiple choice answer. You could say, Mr. and  Mrs. Prospect, would you be more comfortable spending $1000, $5000 or  $10,000.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  84

## Page 85

There are as many techniques in redirecting questions as the mind can  conceive. Can you think of some on your own right now? Why not make a  list of all the different ways you can ask questions - positive, negative, multiple choice, “Magic Lamp”. Think about all the different ways and invent a  few of your own. Remember, questions are the way to get to closing sales  or getting out of sales, getting it over quickly.  We only have so many hours in a day. We can go out and knock on a hundred doors a day and get rejected, rejected, rejected. As the old traditional  sale’s gurus used to say, Knock on a hundred doors and if 99 people say ‘no’, the 100th person will say ‘yes’. That’s great to have that kind of motivation, but do you really want to spend 3 minutes with a prospect or do you  want to spend 3 hours with them? If you can learn very quickly that there’s  no need, no money, no basis for making a commitment, then you’re working smarter. We all have 24 hours in a day. We can use 8 hours for sales,  we need 8 hours for sleep and we need the rest of the time for eating and  doing the things that we’re busy doing in our life.  The difference between someone being successful and someone who is a  failure is that the successful person uses his time smarter. I don’t mind if  someone says 'no' to me as long as I find out quickly. Questions are the  way this method works. This is a question-based method, once again. We  don’t give presentations until we are ready to close. We are going to get  the information we need in order to determine whether we can move forward or whether it’s over. And sometimes it’s a good thing when it’s over. Now, let’s move on to the real nitty gritty. Let’s move on to the Staircase of  Success of the G.U.T.S. Selling Method; the heart of the G.U.T.S. Selling  Method is the Staircase of Success. I want you to take a plain sheet of  paper. I’d like you to draw on that sheet of paper a staircase. A vertical  line, a horizontal line and three little steps. That’s all you have to do. Leave  yourself enough room because we are going to name each one of these  steps. Within each one of these 3 steps is what we call the baby steps.  We’ll go over the Staircase of Success and then we’ll break it down into  each individual step. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  85

## Page 86

The 1st step should be headed as The Agenda Step. The 2nd Step should  be called The Qualification and the 3rd Step should be The Close. Now  this may seem very simplistic at first, but you’ll see my methodology, my  method of madness, in a few moments. Each step is going to be broken  down into sub-steps or what I call baby steps. And the beauty of the  method is you are no longer having to guess or go in blind. You have a  plan. We always want to have a plan. Here we have a method and we go  step-by-step-by-step. That is how I got to the Staircase of Success. We’re  not going to skip any steps. We’re always going from The Agenda to The  Qualification to The Close. We’re not going to jump from one step to another step because when we skip steps; we tend to trip and fall, don’t we?  We are in control and we work it as a method. I came to this idea because I thought a lot about why people use methods.  I thought about Henry Ford and the invention of the assembly line. When  people used to build cars, they would literally take days and days with a  team of men working together to build a car. Then Henry Ford came to the  idea of letting people work on an assembly line, essentially like a railroad  track. He’d set apart different groups. Each group would have a different  responsibility. He discovered that by working in a methodical assembly  line, the process of building a car went from days to literally hours. He  found that it was a better way to build a car. In terms of sales, instead of jumping around and using tricky maneuvers,  going from presentation to close to qualification, which is crazy and unproductive, we now have a method. Instead of being subservient and being a  second class citizen to the prospect, we are now in control. We are going  to have a lot of fun with our method. We are going to make a heck of a lot  more money and feel great about ourselves. We’re going to have a lot of  self-esteem in the process because we’re in control. I can’t tell you how  many times I went to sales presentations and I felt subservient. I felt like a  2nd or 3rd class citizen. I was swinging at a pinata with a blindfold on. I  had no idea whether or not I was going to make a sale. The prospect was  the one in total control; in my world that’s wrong, unproductive and not  working smart. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  86

## Page 87

Now, let’s get back to the basics. The 1st step in our ascending Staircase  of Success is The Agenda step. The Agenda step is broken down into 3  baby steps. The 1st baby step is Permission to ask Questions. The 2nd  baby step is to Draw a road map. The 3rd baby step within the Agenda is  It’s OK to Say 'No'. Now let’s go over these 3 steps in the Agenda. When we start a sales conversation, we are supposed to have all of this  rapport, silly chitchat and pretentious bonding. I entirely disagree with that.  I don’t think any prospect or any salesman is going out to make friends.  Yes, of course, it’s wonderful if we can like each other and have a good and  fruitful relationship. The purpose of doing business is doing business and to  get paid. We are not going to be so transparent and so pretentious that we  talk about baseball scores, weather and the like. That’s a waste of your  time and it’s a waste of the prospect’s time. They know exactly what you’re  trying to do. Why don’t we do something really differently? Why don’t we  be up-front? Why don’t we be straight-forward? Why don’t we be honest  with the prospect and instead of trying to make a new best friend, let’s just  try to get some trust going here? Let’s change the way the buyer and the  seller, the salesman and the prospect react to each other. There are so many preconceived notions by buyers about how the sales  person should be acting. When you say the word “salesman” to most people, they’re going to think ‘tricky, polyester suit, high pressure’. They have  all these negative connotations about what a salesperson really is. The result is that the buyer has to be defensive. They know you might be acting  very friendly towards them because you want to get money from them. You  want to make the sale. Of course you do, but don’t you want to get it in a  way where you can also have respect and trust? Wouldn’t you love to have  a relationship with your prospect where it’s more like a doctor and patient  relationship? That’s why I developed this Agenda Step. The 1st baby step is Permission to Ask Questions. Have you ever met a  salesperson who said, Mr. Prospect, would you mind if I asked you a few  questions? Then I can see which way I can help you or maybe I can’t help  you. Would that be a problem for you? Have you ever met a salesperson  who asked permission to ask questions? I’ve never heard of anyone. They  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  87

## Page 88

just kind of go into it – their presentation. I think when you are asking permission, you are gaining a certain amount of “up-frontness" and frankness  with the prospect. I’ve never heard anyone say 'no’ to me when I ask permission to ask questions. In setting the Agenda, I’m setting the way we are  going to be doing business today.  The next baby step within the Agenda is to Draw a Road Map. Many  times, as I said earlier, the buyer has preconceived notions. They’re wondering what’s going on. They’re doing a lot of Kreskin style mind reading, if  you will. What is the salesperson up to? Why don’t we just eliminate the  guessing, the mind reading and tell the prospect what’s going to happen  before it happens? We’re going to Draw a Road Map and it will sound  something like this:  Mr. Prospect, if you don’t mind, I’d like to ask your permission to ask a few  questions and I’d like to ask you basically why we’re talking today. What’s  the purpose of this conversation? Why am I here? What would you like to  see happen? I’d like to ask you some questions about what you’re comfortable spending and how you make commitments and decisions. Would  that be all right? Now that’s the Road Map. I basically told the prospect what’s going to be  happening before it happens. There’s no second guessing. They don’t  have to worry about pressure or anything. I got this idea, once again, getting back to my dentist story. I went to a really good dentist whom I've been  seeing for years in San Diego. I had a tooth that had to be drilled and the  dentist told me, Claude, I’m going to swab inside your mouth with some  Ambesol. I’m going to give you this needle which contains Novocaine, then  I’m going to drill the tooth. He told me (without getting too morbid) about the  whole procedure. He told me what he was going to do before he did it. So  there were no surprises, no shocks. I didn’t have to worry; my anxiety was  eliminated. The same thing should occur in sales. Let’s Draw a Road Map.  Let’s tell the prospect what’s going to happen before it happens.  The 3rd baby step of the Agenda is It’s OK to Say 'No'. I don’t know about  you, but I have never met a salesperson yet who said, Mr. Diamond, I’m  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  88

## Page 89

going to show you my product, I’m going to answer all of your questions  and if it’s not right for you and if you’re not comfortable with the product or  service, if you don’t like the style, if it’s not within your budget, it’s OK to say  'no' to me. Can you do that, Mr. Diamond? I remove all the stress, all the  pressure, from the sales process by giving all of my prospects permission  to say 'no' to me. It sounds something like this: Miss Prospect, if it’s all right with you, I’d like to ask you a few questions.  What I basically want to find out is why we are talking today, what your  needs are, what you are comfortable spending and how you make decisions. At the end of our conversation, you can ask me some questions and  what I’d like us to do is to reach a conclusion about whether we should go  ahead and do business. If you don’t feel my product or service is right for  you or my house (if this is relating to real estate) is not right for you or you  don’t want to move in, I want you to feel comfortable enough to say 'no' to  me. Can you do that Miss Prospect?  The answer is usually, Sure, I can say 'no'. Then I continue, I also hope  you can say 'yes' to me. I’d like to do business with you, but I want you to  know it’s OK to say 'no' to me and we’ll still be friends. I don’t believe in  pressuring people, but what I’d like to know is that at the end of this conversation, you’ll either say 'yes' or 'no'. You can’t say you’ll think about it or  you’ll get back to me. People say that they’ll think about it because they  don’t want to hurt the salesman’s feelings. I want you to know up-front that  you don’t have to worry about that. I’m here to help you come to your own  decision and your own conclusion. If you don’t think this is right for you and  you are not comfortable, you can say 'no' to me. Is that all right with you? I challenge you, ladies and gentlemen, have you ever heard any salesperson in any situation - selling a car or life insurance or anything - who told  you to say 'no'? This brings me back to my original premise. We have to  stop the adversarial relationship. We’re not out looking to make our new  best friend with the prospect. We do want their respect and their trust. I  know that when we go to a prospect and we lay out the Road Map ahead of  time, when we ask permission to ask questions and we tell them it’s OK to  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  89

## Page 90

say 'no', we provide them with the most important thing in the whole process and that’s trust. Now we’re ready to move up the staircase. We’ve moved from the Agenda  step to the next step and that is Qualification. This is where we get the information to determine whether or not we have someone with whom we  can do business. Qualification is broken down into 4 baby steps which are: Needs Money/Finance Time  Commitment Let’s start with the first one – Needs. It comes back to what we talked  about earlier - Why do people buy things? What are their needs? What is  their passion? What is their desire? Why are they talking to us? What is  their interest level? People buy things because they have to satisfy their  needs. Are their needs strong and passionate or are they very weak and  academic? What I want you to do on your sheet of paper is to draw a scale  of 1-10. 1-5, like a little barometer is Academic and 6-10 is the emotion,  passion, motivation. People buy things because they become emotional about them. Let’s take  an example of someone we talk to who says, I’m just looking. I just want to  gather some information and kind of mull it over. That’s someone who has  really weak needs. That’s someone we commonly refer to as having the  paralysis of analysis. That’s someone who gathers information. Some  people might refer to them as tire kickers or time-wasters. Their needs are  not very strong right now. On the other side of the barometer is where someone becomes emotional,  upset or even hysterical about their needs. An example would be someone  whose car breaks down in a bad neighborhood and it’s getting to be dark  and they are getting scared. Are their needs strong? Do they need a tow  truck? Are they just going to sit there for a long time? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  90

## Page 91

In real estate, we might want to talk about prospects who are renting a  house and they are looking to eventually get into (buy) something. They’ve  been renting for a long time and there’s no rush. There’s no sense of urgency. They have another year on their contract. That’s someone who  would be something like a 3, 4 or 5 on the intellectual scale. But a prospective tenant-buyer – now that would be someone who may be tired of  paying rent. Maybe they have a noisy neighbor. They’re looking for equity,  appreciation, they are looking for pride of ownership. That’s someone who  might be more emotional about their needs. They’re ready to take action  because they are emotional. People buy things because they are concerned and upset, not because they are studying the material and reviewing it. So you must determine the needs of this prospect. How urgent are  their needs? You are going to have to (going back to our questions), ask questions like,  Mr. Prospect, why are we talking today? What are you looking for? You’re  going to ask questions like, I know you are renting right now. Why do you  want to buy a house when you are perfectly happy renting? You are going  to try to find their needs and if you can’t find their needs, you have to create  needs. If you do find needs, you are going to exacerbate their needs,  make them worse. People only buy things because their needs are becoming very important to them, very emotional, very stressful. Someone who  has been renting for a while who has no problems or needs and is comfortable, is going to stay in that property and probably not take an action. Do  you really want to drive your car through traffic and meet somebody who is  not going to take any action? If, on the other hand, you get someone on  the phone, you ask the right questions, you determine they want to get into  a home which they can own and they’re ready to make that move, isn’t that  the person who is worth meeting, spending the time with? Needs are very very important. You have to determine needs. If there are no needs, it’s  over. If you can’t get someone who seems concerned, compassionate or  emotional about their needs, it’s over. There’s no sense going any further,  no sense giving a presentation and no sense moving further up the staircase. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  91

## Page 92

The 2nd baby step is a really important one. It is Money/Finance. As I  said earlier, money is the subject we have to talk about very early on in the  process. Most salespeople are afraid to talk about money in the beginning;  they want to talk about it way in the end. They are too scared, they’re worried about getting some kind of rejection. We have to talk about the money  up-front and we have to have some stick-to-it-iveness in our redirection, in  our questions. You have to say, I know that you want to get into a house  and you want to do it soon. Have you set aside money for your purchase?  Have you thought about how much money you’d like to pay in terms of  rent? How much would you like to put down as a commitment toward option consideration? Some people play their cards, like in poker, very close  to their chests. They might not want to give away that information. You  have to keep redirecting. You have to keep asking questions, with finesse  mind you, because remember, questions can be very aggressive, very arrogant. They can be very abrasive. So be careful how you ask your questions. The 3rd and final step of the G.U.T.S. Selling Method is the Close. This is  where we get to finally make our presentation and we finally get to go to the  bank, as we say, or get paid. The close is broken down into 4 baby steps.  These steps include: The Review Satisfy Ask the Question Triple C The Review is basically where we are going to repeat the information we  have learned in the entire Qualification and Agenda Steps. It’s where we  are going to go over and basically summarize what we’ve agreed to and  what we’ve learned from our question-based method. It will sound something like: Miss Prospect, thank you for allowing me to ask you these questions and as I said, if my product can help you, that’s wonderful. If it can’t,  you are free to say 'no'. From our discussion, I have learned that you are  looking to get out of renting, that you have been renting for ten years,  you’ve spent thousands of dollars and you want to move as soon as possiHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  92

## Page 93

ble because you want to get into a home of your own. You want security,  you want tax benefits and you’d like a nice quiet place in a good school district for your children. You told me that you have a budget of $10,000 for a  down payment, you can afford $1500/month rent and you are the sole decision maker in this entire process. Is that basically a good summarization  of what we’ve discussed, Miss Prospect? As you can see, we’re reviewing everything the prospect has said. We’re  using the information she gave us, based on our questions, our redirections  and we’re keeping everything in the forefront. We’re keeping a certain  amount of urgency. We’re trying to keep the needs of the prospect strong.  We’re trying to keep her emotional because we know that is why people  buy things.  The next baby step in our Close Step is what we call the Satisfaction. The  Satisfaction is essentially where we finally, believe it or not, where we get to  give our presentation. If there is one thing that is different from my  G.U.T.S. Selling Method than any other method out there, it is that we do  not give the presentation until the very end. And the logical reason is, how  can we give a presentation if we don’t know what to present? If we don’t  know what the needs are? If we have multiple products and services, specifically in Creative Real Estate, we don’t want to talk about a million dollar  home when the prospect has a small condo budget. Right? So we don’t  give an overbroad presentation. We wait until we know how to satisfy the  needs. We relate to all the information they gave us. We relate our product, service or our real estate, depending upon whether they are a buyer or  seller. It would sound something like this: Ms. Prospect, you told me why  you are looking for a home and what your budget is. We have a property in  the neighborhood you’re looking in. It is $10,000 down and $1,200/month.  It is a rent-to-own and you can move into it in the next 30 days. I think this  will solve your problem. It will give you the opportunity to plan so you can  save and correct your credit. Then you can buy this house anytime within  the next 2 years. That’s why I've been asking you all these questions about  rent-to-own. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  93

## Page 94

What I basically did in this 2nd baby step is try to satisfy all of the needs of  the prospect. That’s why we call it the Satisfaction. You can call it a presentation or whatever you like, but we now know how to direct our product or  service or real estate toward the qualification of the prospect. You can see  how this is a much stronger method than faking it and giving overbroad  presentations and free consultations. After we’ve asked the right questions, we can direct our presentation toward this prospect in exactly the  way they’ve explained their situation to us. The 3rd part of the baby step, the only close strategy you’ll get from me, is  called Ask the Last Question. The Last Question basically is where you  go to the prospect and say something like this: Ms. Prospect, we’ve talked  about what you’re looking for. We talked about a property I have that I  think will fulfill your needs. What would you like to do next? Hopefully, at  this point, you have a high assurance that she is going to say 'yes' because  you’ve taken her step-by-step. You are going to use her own words from  the information that she gave you. You are only going to ask one simple  question. You’re not going to sound like the typical salesperson who keeps  asking for the order in different, obvious, tacky and cheesy ways. You are  just going to go to the prospect and say, This is what you said you’re looking for. This is what I have. What would you like to do next? So you see,  we only ask one question and if we do this the right way, we have a very  high likelihood that we’re going to get the order right now. A big psychological difference here is that we’re not asking for the order as much as the  prospect has made the decision to give us the order. She doesn’t feel  pressured or manipulated. The prospect made the decision. We led her  down the path by taking an interest in her. Once again, we’re back to the doctor/patient relationship. When you go to  see a doctor, he doesn’t sound like a salesperson. He asks questions,  wants to determine where you’re hurting, why you’re hurting, when you’re  hurting and arrive at a diagnosis. The patient would not go to the doctor  and say, I want to read your literature and then ask a lot of silly questions.  Why? Because there is a certain respect in that relationship. I want you to  create that same respect by asking questions the way we’ve been talking,  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  94

## Page 95

the same as a doctor would. The prospect sees you as someone who is  professional and who truly has an interest. That’s why we ask questions.  Hopefully, we’ve received the order after we’ve asked the last question and  then we move to the final step, the Triple C – the Confirm, the Change and the Close. When we Confirm an order, we go to the prospect and say,  Mr. and Mrs. Prospect, are you comfortable with this decision? Are you all  right with it? You’re not going to call me tomorrow and tell me you’ve  changed your mind or anything? Most salespeople, once they get an order,  get real excited. They jump up and down, take the check and run, only to  find that the next day the prospect had some kind of remorse. This has  happened to me many times in Creative Real Estate because I ran too fast  and I didn’t tie up the loose ends. I want you, in the Triple C process, to  first Confirm the sale. This sounds something like: Mr. and Mrs. Prospect,  are you comfortable with this decision? Can you keep your commitment?  You’re not going to call me tomorrow and tell me that you’ve changed your  mind, are you? Once again, this goes back to having the G.U.T.S., the  spine, to make sure that you truly have gotten an order. If you can do this  one little step, you will never get a buyer, a prospect, who will call you the  next day with any kind of remorse. You’ve taken care of potential problems  up-front. The next part of the Triple C is Change. Sometimes you have to modify or  change or re-negotiate steps. The prospect may say something like, I’m  not comfortable putting $10,000 down. Is there any way we can finance it? Now you will ask the prospect, If we could finance it, what would you say or  If we could finance it, what would you be comfortable putting down? You’re  going to change, you’re going to modify, you’re going to re-negotiate in this  one part of the Triple C. That’s why we call it the Change. You’ve got the  sale. You’ve got to fine tune it a little bit. You’ve got to fix some things.  This happens in any sales situation, especially a great deal in Creative  Real Estate.  The last step in the baby step is the final Close. This is where you go to  the prospect, you thank them for the order, you reconfirm the order and  then you’re done for the day.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  95

## Page 96

Now that we’ve gone over the Final Step, I want to talk about how this entire method can relate to you in your Creative Real Estate business. In  Lease Purchasing, when I mentor people, I specifically tell them that there  are two things we have to do. We have to find buyers and we have to find  sellers. We have to find property owners or landlords and we have to find  tenant-buyers. We have to work smart with these people. We have to  qualify them so we are not wasting our time with tire kickers. When we are talking about the tenant-buyers, the buyers or the renters, our  first point of contact is usually on the phone. What many of us did in the  old days was to meet with these people. We’d meet at a coffee shop or  we’d meet for breakfast or lunch. We’d go to the property and show it to  them or we would spend a great deal of time in multiple phones calls giving  away a lot of free intellectual information. Those days are over with the  G.U.T.S. Sales Method. I can tell you frankly that I did it the old world way  where I spent a lot of time with people and I didn’t have a clue about their  needs, about the money to satisfy those needs, their urgency, time frame or  how they made commitments. With the tenant-buyer, for instance, the quick  key question is: Why are you looking for a property? You may want to think  ahead of time what questions you need to ask your prospective buyer in  order to do business? My nickname, by the way is “One Call Close  Claude”. Why? Because in one phone call, I can determine if this is a  tenant-buyer with whom I can do business or if I should politely get off the  phone quickly. Beforehand you want to think about the questions you need to ask in order  to determine whether or not you can do business with this person. Take a  fresh piece of paper and write down those questions. Let’s talk about a few  of them. Why are you looking to get into a property? Why don’t you continue renting? We talked about negative and positive redirection, when you  go in the opposite direction the prospect expects you to which is also the  opposite direction of your competition. When you do this correctly, your  prospect will do the presentation for you. They’ll tell you why they are looking for a property, what their sense of urgency is, what their time frame is.  They’ll tell you everything you need to know. Your prospect will do the work  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  96

## Page 97

for you if you ask your questions – you redirect your questions - in a positive or negative way.  Remember they expect you to be forthcoming with your answers. You  might just want to turn their questions into your questions and even go in  the opposite direction that they expect you to go. So you are going to write  down questions like: What are you looking for in a house? When did you want to move? Do you have a budget? Do you want to spend the same amount on rent or more? How much money can you put down? What stopped you from just going out and buying your own property?  Why are we talking today, Mr. Prospect? Can you imagine if you could get all this information? If you could read the  mind of your prospect and you knew they didn’t have any money to do a  deal, they weren’t going to move for at least 6 months. They can’t make  decisions unless they have their partner or spouse available. Wouldn’t it be  great to read their mind and know this all up-front before you spend countless hours giving away free information?  We can’t be mind readers, so we have to learn how to ask the questions  with finesse, redirect the questions so we get the information we need to  know up-front. You think about the questions and practice a little. When  someone asks you a question, turn their question into a question so that  you learn to work smart with your prospective tenant-buyers. If your tenantbuyer doesn’t qualify, get as much information as possible. Put it into your  database. Maybe set up a tickler file so you call them back at another time.  But know right up-front it is not worth getting in your car; it’s not worth mailing tons of literature. It’s not worth meeting them, waiting around and giving tours of houses. This is the difference between someone who can make  a very high 6 or 7 figure income and someone who is just spinning their  wheels like a gerbil in a cage. Eventually, they get frustrated from all of the  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  97

## Page 98

rejection and quit. We have to learn to work smart and you have a right to  ask these questions of your prospective tenant-buyer.  Let’s change gears and talk about the seller or the landlord of a property  with whom we’re looking to do business. These are the questions to ask  the owner of the property:  Why are you selling the home? What are you willing to get for the home? How did you get to the price for the home? Would you be willing to let me rent your home and buy it in the future? Can we work together if there is a way we can move your home in the next  30 days for the top sales price without paying a real estate commission, if  you’re not a realtor? These are the questions you want to be prepared to ask ahead of time.  You want to ask them, once again, with finesse. You want to ask them in  such a way that you’re not giving information, but rather you’re receiving information. You want to find out if this seller is motivated. On a 1-10 scale,  what are their levels of need? Are they living in the house or is the house  vacant? Why are they selling the house? Are they moving? Are they being transferred? Are they building a larger home? Is it a family situation?  Why do they have this house for sale or for rent? You need this hard information up-front so that you can determine how you can do business.  What strategy will be used? If lease purchasing, are you going to do a  sandwich or are you going to do an assignment? Are you going to do a  land sale contract? If you’re a realtor, how are you going to list the property? Is the listing commission a question here? Do they want 6% or are  they willing to do it for 3%? These are the questions you need to ask. Your competition is going to jump in because they’re so glad to get a prospect. They’re going to just give it all away. They’re going to give a presentation. They’re going to do their Power Point million dollar slide show. You,  on the other hand, are going to sound like a doctor. You’re going to be asking the questions so you can do your diagnosis, so you can determine if  this is a prospect you can do business with or someone to get away from  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  98

## Page 99

very quickly. Remember, 'no', is a great answer if you get it early. You don’t  want to get a 'no' after investing hours and days and months on a prospective deal. Isn’t it better to get a 'no' up-front? I’ve discussed buyers, sellers, landlords and the kind of questions we need  to ask while we are working through the G.U.T.S. Selling Method. In the  old days, I used to just sit on the phone for hours and answer all the questions until one day my wife heard me giving away all this free information  and really gave it to me. She said, You were willing to pay the price. Why  don’t you make your prospects pay the price? From that one idea from my  wife, I discovered there is a different way to do real estate. I could ask the  questions, qualify the prospect and I could consult with people. Many of  you have spent a lot of time and money on education and doing deals. You  don’t have to give it away. You can consult with people. You can get paid  for your time, knowledge and energy. But, you have to qualify that prospect. What are his needs and how urgent are they? What is his time  frame? What is his availability of money to pay you? How does she make  decisions for paying consultants or for products? I sell a great deal of  products, really good informational products. I’ll ask people what they’re  looking to accomplish, what their budget is. Not everybody is willing to pay  for a consultant or a mentor. They don’t have the money available right  now, but maybe they want to spend a smaller amount on informational  products. It’s better for me to learn that up-front than investing an hour or  two on someone who can’t afford a consultant. So, no matter what aspect  of Creative Real Estate, whether you are doing sandwiches, assigning,  buying properties, foreclosures, selling products or consulting or coaching  your clients, you need to use the G.U.T.S. Sales Method if you want to be  successful. It is the million dollar skill and it is necessary to be successful  in real estate or any other business. I’ve been mentoring and teaching people for years. I’ve had marvelous  people who really took their studies seriously. They knew the strategies.  They knew the different ways of doing Creative Real Estate. Not just lease  purchasing, my favorite, but other guru’s favorite strategies. And here’s the  sad thing, they still fail. You know why? Because no one ever taught them  how to sell, how to market and how to negotiate. No one ever taught them  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  99

that sales is not just about going out and giving away free information. It’s  about working smart, feeling good about yourself, having high self-esteem,  asking the questions and moving from step-to-step in an organized methodic way. This is the way you become successful in Creative Real Estate. Overview of the G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method I would not be successful in sales if I did not learn this question based  method. It allows you to have a blank check for the rest of your life, no  matter what product or service you’re involved in. I’ve worked a long time  to get to the financial freedom that my family and I now enjoy. We live in  different parts of the country – in the mountains in Colorado and by the  beach in San Diego. We have a wonderful life, we’re debt free. We make  a wonderful income, we have financial security and it’s all about learning  how to give good phone. It’s about having a Sales Method so that you’re in  control, so that you feel good about yourself, so you’re not getting the rejection like all of your competition. I often tell people that I define success as follows: You can take everything  away from me, all the money, the security, the houses, the cars, everything.  You could literally take it all away from me, put me in Times Square with  nothing in my pockets and I guarantee you that I will find a way to get to a  telephone. I will find a way to be up and running and I will be back on top  in 30 days. And when you can say that, you’re truly successful. It’s not  about the money, the wealth and the things you accumulate. It’s about the  freedom, the self-esteem to know you can do it over and over again. That’s  what the Sales Method did for me. It’s not so much about the type of business, but rather about having a method that allows you to be in control, to  live your life the way you want, to feel good about yourself. No one is ever  going to reject you again. You have the ability to reject the prospect.  You’re in control with the G.U.T.S. Sales Method. Let’s do a quick review. We’ve basically talked about the 3 steps, the  Agenda, Qualification and the Close. We’re not going to do transparent  or obvious bonding and rapport because we know that’s superficial. What  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  100

## Page 101

we are going to do is gain trust. We’re going to ask permission to ask  questions. We’re going to Draw a Road Map with the prospect and we’re  going to tell them it’s OK to say 'no' to us because we like the word 'no'.  We love the word 'yes' more, but we want to get the 'no’s' out of the way so  we have the time to spend with the 'yes' or what we call the high probability  prospects. We then move up to Qualification. Instead of giving presentations right  away, like our competition does, we have the right to ask questions. We  have the right to know what their needs are. If we can’t find their needs, we  have to create their needs. We know our business, we know why people  sell properties, why people want to move into them and we have to raise  these needs. We have to exacerbate existing needs, make them worse  because we know people buy things when they are emotional, not because  they are studying and reviewing information. They take action because  they are emotionally involved. We know that we have to find out what kind  of money they have available because if they have no money, it doesn’t  matter how strong their needs are, it’s over. We have to know the time frame. We have to know how they make commitments. We need to have all this information up-front and remember,  one of my most important rules is that there are no presentations given upfront. You give no presentations, no matter how much you are dying to,  you don’t answer their questions until you’ve qualified the prospect up-front.  You’re in control.  We also get all this information by asking questions. That is the fuel for ascending the Staircase of Success. We have to ask questions in a certain  way, with finesse. We have to ask them the right way. We redirect their  questions. Sometimes we do the ignorant redirection or the multiple choice  redirection, at other times we enlist the positive or negative redirection and  other times we make use of the magic lamp redirection. There are so  many different ways that we can redirect the questions, with finesse, that  they don’t even see us asking the questions. And we feel wonderful about  ourselves because we are getting the hard information that determines  whether we should spend more time with this prospect or it is over. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  101

## Page 102

We then move to the final step, the Close Step. This is where we review all  the information. We then see if our product, service or real estate can satisfy their needs. Then we move to the Triple C. We Confirm, Change and  Close. I’m going to tell you one caveat here. This is a tough method. This  is going to take practice. My mentor used to say, Claude, everybody wants to be rich, but few are willing to pay the price. The price of success, of financial freedom is getting a method that works. You are going to have to  put time into this. This is not intuitive. When you were in school, you were  told that when a teacher asked you a question, you had to answer. Now  along comes Claude and he’s telling you, Don’t answer questions, rather  redirect them into other questions because that’s your right. This is going  to take time. This is going to take practice, but I can assure you that this is  the way to success. Sales the Million Dollar Skill. I would not have the  freedom and the wonderful lifestyle today if it wasn’t for sales. Please remember that I was a former “World’s Worst Salesman”. I was the kid in the  back of the room who never raised his hand. I was the person who never  spoke up.

Sales Skills Article  Sales Skills are the Missing Link for Success in Creative Real Estate  By: Claude W. Diamond J.D. Why Do Creative Real Estate Investors Fail? What is the missing link  for success in the best business in the world? There are more book and  tape packages, gurus, boot camps, seminars, conventions, speakers,  internet news groups than ever before and yet something is REALLY  WRONG. I remember when I discovered Lease Purchasing, I was on pure  adrenaline. I finally had a strategy for making money in real estate  without all the traditional hassles like banks, repairs, large down payments and tenant management (yuck). Things were going great compared to the way they used to be (I was making money without the  usual investor problems), but I was still not getting to the higher income levels that I set as a goal for myself. I was making tons of cold  phone calls everyday and contacting all kinds of owners and landlords.  Some folks would hang up, some would ask me questions for hours  and literally get a free consultation, some lied to me in order to get my contracts for free, others were out and out rude. It was a tiring process of phone calls, going to properties where the owner said one thing  on the phone and then another when I arrived. I was hearing stuff like  ‘I have to think about it’, or ‘I’ll get back to you’, ‘send me a brochure’,  ‘leave me your contracts’ or the famous, ‘I have to speak with my  spouse’. I was working VERY HARD and yes, things were better than they had  ever been in my investor career, but I wanted more! I wanted to work  smarter, have more fun and Control in the selling process, skip all the  prospect rejection and make a much higher income. I knew that I  needed to learn how to be a better communicator, yes a better salesperson. Up until that time, the only sales training I had was from KMart! (I learned how to turn on the blue light gizmo that you often see  wheeled around the store and give the corny speech they teach you!)  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  103

Later in Corporate America, I was given some brochures and an order  book and told to go see existing clients and some prospects. In other  words, I had no training whatsoever. If I was going to succeed, I  needed something more. I began an education process very similar to most of you. I bought all  the popular sales books, tapes and attended several weekend seminars. The information was usually more motivational than hands-on  practical. I needed an organized system of sales that was unlike the  tired old systems that everyone else was using. I asked everyone I  knew who were successful in sales the following question, who is the  best salesman you ever met? I kept asking until I heard the same  name repeated over and over. His name was Max. So I sought Max out and sure enough everyone was right, he was the  best salesman I ever met! He was a self-made millionaire who reinvented sales because he found that he was encountering the exact  same problems that all salespeople had to endure. Time wasters, lack  of respect, no control over the sales process, frustrating cold calls, indecisive prospects, free consultations and what he considered to be  the greatest sin of all, Not going to the BANK often enough. Max decided that most of the sales techniques being taught were the  same old tired stuff that all the prospects knew almost as well as the  salesman. It was time for something new. A new way of selling that  would qualify the prospect in the first couple of minutes, right upfront. It would allow the salesman to make a contract and close the  prospect before any sales presentation would be made, it would allow  the sales professional to have tons of fun and feel totally empowered  and in control. Best of all, it would give you the skills to make as much  money as you wanted! I was really excited because now I had the missing pieces of knowledge that I needed to reach my income goals in Creative Real Estate  with Lease Purchasing. Let me share with you some revolutionary  ideas that will change your life, empower you and raise your confidence level to heights you never knew could be possible, put you in  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  104

control in the sales process and make you enough money to choke a  horse. A. Sales is about you going to the (fill in your name here) BANK.  (Sorry if I just offended the touchy feelys). B. Sales is the most important skill you can have to make your business grow and to be prosperous; Sales is a Million Dollar Skill (Hmmm,  this would make a great title for a sales tape set). If you are in sales,  it is about you making a difference and solving peoples’ problems with  your products and services. It is not about being a free consulting  service. You need a way to constantly learn, keep focused and reinforce your techniques. C. The Three Minute Qualifying Rule. You must be able to qualify your  prospect on the phone in three minutes or less. You must learn the art  of asking questions and reversing questions from your prospect in order to find out whether you have a live one or a time waster. Do they  have a problem you can solve? Can they afford to fix it? Are they the  decision maker? These are the questions that absolutely must be  asked and answered, otherwise you are giving a free consultation and  just wasting a great deal of time. Why spend time with the 80% who  will never buy when you can qualify and work with the HOT 20% who  will? D. You must create an understanding or Agenda during the initial conversation with the prospect. There is no sense in not getting to the  point; you must set the ground rules in the beginning or you will have  to argue them later and possibly lose the sale you worked so hard for.  Learn how to get the prospect to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and none of that ‘I  have to think about it’ or ‘I will get back to you later’ stuff. E. Stop begging for the order! Everyone wants to buy, but few want to  be sold. Let the prospect come to their own natural conclusion and  give you the sale. You just lead them by re-direction. F. Never make cold calls! I don’t know about you, but I hate cold calling folks out of the blue and being treated like a long lost cousin who  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  105

## Page 106

is asking for money. Create an environment where you only make  warm or hot calls. G. Make the Prospect Uncomfortable. If your prospect is feeling uncomfortable then you’re doing something RIGHT! That’s right, the  pressure should always be on the Prospect, not on you. If you’re feeling uncomfortable then you’re doing something wrong. You should be  in control and have fun while making money. H. Never carry a brochure, business card, pen, attache, nada, nothing.  Believe it or not, this one idea will help you to close more deals and  you won’t have a sore arm or back from lugging too much unnecessary  stuff! I. Get a G.U.T.S. Sales System (great untraditional-unorthodox techniques of selling) now, whether you have a product or service to sell or  just want to become a better communicator. Trying to sell something  without a simple system is like going to a Chucky Cheese pizza palace  on a rainy Saturday WITHOUT ASPIRIN. If you aren’t having fun and  making buckos, then you are doing something wrong. There are no  bad prospects only bad salespeople.      HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  106

G.U.T.S. SELLING METHOD EXAMPLES Why Typical Creative Real Estate Investors do NOT go to the bank!                                                   (Because they don’t have a G.U.T.S.™ Sales System!) You know I love creative real estate and that I think it is one of the best ways to have  financial freedom while working from home. There are a few problems however: many  investors that I meet work way too hard, do too much unprofitable running around and  eventually quit out of frustration. There are plenty of books, tapes and seminars on real  estate strategies, but nobody is spending any time on the Sales Skills necessary to  make it in this business. No one except us, that is.   The following is a tasty sample of The G.U.T.S.™ Sales Method.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Do you give good phone? Investors make crazy offers on the phone without  qualification which either aggravate the prospect, create an adversarial relationship or  are downright embarrassing. Prospect: What is your offer? Typical Investor: I am looking for a home that I can buy with little or nothing down.  Would you do owner financing, carry back your equity, refinance the property and split  the cash with me? Would you put the property into a trust, sign the deed over to me,  move out and let me put tenants in it with little or nothing down? G.U.T.S.™ Investor: Mr. Seller, I don’t know what I want to offer you, but would you  mind if I ask you a few questions so we can determine whether or not we can do a deal  together? What do you want? What are you looking for, how do you make decisions of  this important nature? What is your time frame?  Rule: Ask questions, act like a professional, not like a person who just came from a  weekend get rich seminar. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Do you suffer from the agony of Premature Presentation?  Most real estate investors give free information without getting any information or commitment from the prospect in return.  Prospect: How would you market my home? Typical Investor: Mr. Seller. we would take out ads, put up signs, hand out brochures,  Yada-Yada-Yada; (until the prospect falls asleep ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and becomes  comatose from boredom). G.U.T.S.™ Investor: That’s a great question, Mr. Prospect. Why is the marketing of  your home so important to you? You must have asked me that question for a reason.  Prospect: The last investor I worked with did conventional marketing, the home stood  empty and he gave it back to me. What can you do differently?  Note: Our G.U.T.S. salesman does not give out information/presentations, but turns the  question into a question and gets into the head of our prospect to learn what her hot  button is. A smart investor gets enough information first. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  107

## Page 108

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I would rather do it myself!  Prospect: Why do I need you when I can do this myself? Typical Investor: I doubt it, sir, otherwise you would have done it already. We are  highly trained professionals. G.U.T.S.™ Investor: Sir, I was thinking the exact same thing. You strike me as a handson person who is more than capable of marketing his own home. Why bring in a 3rd  party investor and diminish your profits when you can keep it all? Suppose I told you  that we have a consulting program where we provide you with the contracts, a marketing and sales plan and 30 days of unlimited consulting. You would recoup the reasonable consulting fee we charge and still make an up-front profit. Is that something we  should discuss or are we done? Rule: The G.U.T.S. investor turns an objection into a solution and makes money upfront re-marketing his knowledge. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Come on down, I’m Lonely! The seller/owner invariably wants you to come by  the home without making any up-front commitment. Most of the time, the investor  doesn’t get enough information or an up-front commitment. It’s all a waste of gas and  time unless you show some G.U.T.S. and learn that ‘No’ is OK if you hear it in the beginning. Seller: Sounds great. Come on by the home and let’s talk. Typical Investor: I will come by today at 1:00 PM, thank you. G.U.T.S.™ Investor: I would love to come by your home sir, but before I do that, could  you tell me what we need to do in order to make a deal happen today? If I do come by,  can you tell me either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and not, ‘I’ll think about it’? Are you the only person on  the deed? If not, will the other person, spouse, investor be there? Rule: Work Smart and determine up-front that you are going to the home to pick up a  check or a contract.   HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  108

Role-Plays with the G.U.T.S. Sales Method The following pages contain valuable role-plays which were sent to me by a few of  my Mentees. I normally allow my students to record these role-play sessions to  study at a later time. The recording can be transferred to an iPod or audio CD to  listen to and to review. The role-plays are pretty much in their original state with  minimal editing. Role-Plays with Claude Talking to an Investor who wants Free Information and Contracts CLAUDE: Hi John, how can I help you? JOHN: I'm working on this deal. It's my first deal and I'm just not comfortable …. CLAUDE: What kind of deal is it, John? JOHN: I'm hoping to get a lease option from this seller. CLAUDE: What do you want to do with it? Live in it, sublet it, assign it, buy it?  What's your goal here? JOHN: Probably sublet it. CLAUDE: All right. What is the problem?  JOHN: I don't have any forms.  CLAUDE: Just go to your attorney. JOHN: I really don't have one to work with. CLAUDE: That could be a problem. Anything else? JOHN: I have a number of questions about how best to do the deal. Like I said, it  is my first deal. CLAUDE: There are a lot of different ways to do this. Have you taken any  courses, bought any programs or taken any seminars? JOHN: I went to a Ron LeGrand course. CLAUDE: Oh. Good course. So did you call Ron with these questions?  JOHN: Well, he is not exactly easily available. I have never talked to him. CLAUDE: What were you hoping to get from me today, John? HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  109

## Page 110

JOHN: Well, some advice on the best way to do this. Maybe a copy of some forms  and stuff like that. CLAUDE: John, suppose there was a way I could get you the right contracts and  save you all of those expensive attorney fees, get you a manual so you would  know how to market this property, know how to negotiate it and get you some  supplemental CDs and DVDs so you do this the right way? Do you think it would  be worth spending $1595 to do that?  JOHN: Wow. That was a lot more than I was expecting to pay.  CLAUDE: What were you expecting to pay, John? JOHN: Well, I was hoping to get something for free.  CLAUDE: John, how should I reply to that? Do you really want to take advice  from someone who doesn’t place a value on his knowledge? How much is this  property worth?  JOHN: It's worth about $250,000.  CLAUDE: You are going to spend a quarter of a million dollars, but you want free  advice from me? What's wrong with this, John? JOHN: I guess that doesn't make a lot of sense.  CLAUDE: If I thought that little of myself, would you really want to take any advice that I would give you?  JOHN: That's true.  CLAUDE: If you needed surgery, would you want the cheapest doctor or the best? JOHN: Obviously the best.  CLAUDE: You could probably get someone at a clinic for free. JOHN: Yeah, I know. CLAUDE: You could save all of that money.  JOHN: Yeah. CLAUDE: But you might be dead. Life's a trade-off, John. JOHN: Yeah. CLAUDE: You are going to take on a quarter of a million encumbrance. Do you  want to do it the right way or do you want to do it the wrong way, lose money and  end up in court? JOHN: I definitely want to get the deal.  CLAUDE: How are you going to solve the $1595 issue? It is still a lot of money,  as you said. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  110

JOHN: Well, If I come up with $500 now, can I pay the rest in a month? CLAUDE: Oh boy. I don't know. Let me think about that for a second. Let's just  pretend for a minute that I was willing to accept that. You couldn't do that on a  credit card now, could you?  JOHN: I could do the first $1000 on a credit card. CLAUDE: I'm sorry. What? I couldn't hear you?  JOHN: I can do the first $1000 on a credit card. CLAUDE: You put me under a lot of pressure. Are you sure you are comfortable  doing that? I can get it out to you today if that is what you want to do and if I accept it. JOHN: Yeah. I really need to get working on this deal right away. CLAUDE: And the other $595, thirty days from now? On the same credit card? Is  that fair?  JOHN: That will work. CLAUDE: OK, you got it.  Claude Rule: A presentation is nothing more than the dissemination of free  information. Seller is Calling Us with a Desperate Deal CLAUDE: Hello, Diamond Consulting Group. How may I help you? JOHN: Hi, this is John.  CLAUDE: Hi John. This is Claude Diamond. How can I help you today?  JOHN: I've got this house that I am trying to sell and was wondering what is it that  you offer? What kind of program do you have? CLAUDE: I don't know. JOHN: Uh, well I'm wondering whether you can help me? CLAUDE: I don't know, John? What were you hoping to get from me today? I  don't know you. I’ve never talked to you before, have I?  JOHN: No. CLAUDE: I don't know. Did you write me? Do I know anything about this deal  or anything? JOHN: No. I saw… HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  111

CLAUDE: What were you hoping to get from me today, John? JOHN: I was hoping you could buy my house.  CLAUDE: You just call up total strangers and hope they will buy your house?  JOHN: No, I saw your sign that says, ‘We buy Houses’. CLAUDE: Yes, we do have a sign like that. Why are you selling this house? You  don't mind if I ask you a few questions, do you? I usually don't buy houses unless  I get some information. JOHN: I just can't afford to live here anymore. I really need to get rid of it. CLAUDE: OK. You know, that is interesting. Are you living in it now?  JOHN: Yeah. CLAUDE: How much is it worth? Real world. JOHN: About $160,000. CLAUDE: How did you get to that price? JOHN: We had a real estate agent look at it awhile back. CLAUDE: When you asked your real estate agent why he or she can't sell your  house, what was the response?  JOHN: There wasn't enough equity to pay for the real estate agent.  CLAUDE: What did they mean by that? JOHN: Well my mortgage is $160,000 and I would have to come up with money at  the closing. I can't do that. CLAUDE: You mean the house is worth, how much again? JOHN: $160,000. CLAUDE: And the mortgage is $160,000?  JOHN: Right. We had to take out a second to pay some bills and it adds up to  $160,000 now.  CLAUDE: What is your monthly payment on the first and second, John?  JOHN: Between the two of them, about $1,600.  CLAUDE: And this is a house or condo or a Maytag box? JOHN: It's a single family house. CLAUDE: You have a hell of a problem here, John. I don't know how I can help  you. I'll have to think about it for a minute. Let me ask you something. If you did  get an offer for your property, where you wouldn't lose any money, what do you  think your response would be? JOHN: That would be great if I could get my $160,000. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  112

## Page 113

CLAUDE: But you're not going to get $160,000. The bank is going to get it.  JOHN: Oh. Yeah. CLAUDE: Let me think about this for a moment. Who is the decision maker in  this whole situation, John? JOHN: Well, my wife and I would have to agree on this together. CLAUDE: OK. And what is your budget, John? How much would you be able to  pay me if I took this house off your hands?  JOHN: Pay you? CLAUDE: Yeah.  JOHN: I was hoping I wouldn't have to pay you anything. CLAUDE: John, I was hoping that I would be 6’5”, but I am only 5’8”! Wishes  are wonderful things, but you are asking me to take a house that is over encumbered and just pay retail for it. I'm an investor, John. I am not someone who is going to move into this house. JOHN: Right. CLAUDE: So is that a deal killer for us? Frankly, I would need at least $5,000 to  even consider doing this deal with you. JOHN: I don't have $5,000.  CLAUDE: What do you have? Could you share your budget in round numbers?  JOHN: Well, I am almost at the point where I can't even make the next payment.  CLAUDE: You've got a heck of a problem here, John. Suppose that I was willing  to consider this, you wouldn't be able to do this transaction by December 15th,  would you?  JOHN: I could move out by then.  CLAUDE: Are you behind in any payments, if you don't mind my asking?  JOHN: I still haven't made the November payment.  CLAUDE: So you are one month behind literally. JOHN: Right. CLAUDE: You said that's $1,600 a month, right?  JOHN: Yes. CLAUDE: Since I am waiving the $5,000, would you be able to subsidize the rent  for one year? I pay the $1000 and you pay the other $600 for the first year. The  second year, I pay the full $1,600.  JOHN: Yeah, the second is about $600. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  113

## Page 114

CLAUDE: You are the one who took out the second. You're the one who borrowed  the money. Shouldn't you be the one who pays it? JOHN: Yeah.  CLAUDE: Is that something you could afford or be comfortable with? JOHN: Yeah, it would be tough, but that would be better than having it go into  foreclosure.  CLAUDE: Absolutely. Suppose I were to come over to your house, meet with you  and your wife. You like me and I like you. We sign a two year contract to rent this  property with an option to purchase, $1000 per month for the first year's rent,  $1,600 per month for the second year and I'll waive my $5,000 fee. JOHN: Yeah, I would definitely consider that.  CLAUDE: 'Consider it' means what, John? I'm very busy. I'm juggling several  deals right now. Is that something you and your wife would be comfortable with or  should we call it a day?  JOHN: Yes, let's meet.  CLAUDE: And what will happen after we meet? How will your wife feel about  this deal? JOHN: She is pretty desperate to get rid of the house, too. CLAUDE: Tell you what. You talk to your wife about what I offered and can you  call me back at 1 o'clock this afternoon? No. Make it 1:15. JOHN: OK. Let's do that. CLAUDE: Just let me know if you want to move ahead, if your wife is comfortable with it. If she is not, it's OK. But I’d just appreciate a phone call. If she is  comfortable with it, I will come over tonight, I'll re-explain everything and if we  want to move ahead that's wonderful and I can get you out of this property and stop  the possible foreclosure. I'll pay off the back month's encumbrance and we will go  forward.  JOHN: OK. CLAUDE: How does that sound? JOHN: That sounds good. CLAUDE: Good. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  114

'Let's Pretend' Redirection or 'Suppose' Hypothetical Redirection CLAUDE: Hi. How much do you want for your house, John? JOHN: I really want $300,000.  CLAUDE: What do you mean 'really'? JOHN: I need $300,000 to pay off the mortgage … CLAUDE: What's the problem? It sounds like a nice house. Why don't you just  give it to a realtor and sell it for $300,000? JOHN: I've talked to realtors and there's just not enough equity to pay for it; to pay  for the real estate agent.  CLAUDE: You mean you owe $300,000 and you are trying to sell it for $300,000.  JOHN: Well, I owe about $275,000 and if I have to get a realtor involved at 6%,  we are talking an $18,000 commission. I wanted to have some equity so that I  could put it into another house. CLAUDE: Oh, I see. Why don't you refinance the house and take out $25,000?  JOHN: My credit is not great, so a refinance probably wouldn't work.  CLAUDE: Suppose I was able to give you the $300,000, but it would have to be a  delayed closing for at least 12-24 months, what would you say to that offer? JOHN: So that means I wouldn't get any of my money for another year or two? CLAUDE: That's right. JOHN: Well, that wouldn't be my first choice.  CLAUDE: OK. Let me ask you one other thing before I get off the phone. Let's  pretend that I could make it $325,000. What would you say? JOHN: Well, that sounds a lot more interesting. CLAUDE: Which means?  JOHN: Yeah, I would definitely consider that. CLAUDE: And what is involved in 'considering', John? JOHN: Well, I'll have to work through the numbers, but… CLAUDE: The numbers are pretty clear, $325, 000 with a 2 year rental. How  much is your mortgage?  JOHN: The mortgage is $275,000. CLAUDE: I meant the payments? JOHN: About $2,300. CLAUDE: $2,300 seems a little high. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  115

JOHN: Yeah, well like I said, I don't have the greatest credit. CLAUDE: How are you going to buy a new home if you don't have the greatest  credit, if you don't mind my asking? Why don't you stay in your home? JOHN: We are looking at one of those rent-to-own homes. CLAUDE: You are in a nice home now, in a good neighborhood. You’ve got a little equity. Why don't you just stay there and rebuild your credit? Why this great  leap into another house? JOHN: The $2,300 a month is pretty high for us. CLAUDE: I see. That’s a problem for a lot of people. What do you think a house  like that would rent for in your neighborhood? JOHN: Probably for about $1,800. CLAUDE: I guess the ball is in your court, John. I'm willing to do business.  Would you be comfortable doing a rent-to-own? I could work out something. JOHN: Yeah. My problem is I really wanted to have some money for moving and  that kind of thing. CLAUDE: It's just not there, John. Not for this deal. Shall we call it a day? JOHN: No. No. No. CLAUDE: I've got other deals to work on. I'm pretty busy. JOHN: Yeah, I understand. No, let's get together and talk.  CLAUDE: We are talking right now, John. Give me some meat and potatoes. JOHN: Let me talk to my wife about it and get back to you.  CLAUDE: You're a newlywed? JOHN: No. CLAUDE: How long have you been married? JOHN: Ten years. CLAUDE: That's wonderful. You go to your lovely ten year bride and say ‘honey,  a guy wants to buy our house, he'll cover our PITI, but we aren't going to get any  cash out of it’. What's your bride going to say? JOHN: She really wants to move, so I'm sure she'll say ‘yes’. CLAUDE: I'm sorry. What? JOHN: I'm sure she will say ‘yes’. CLAUDE: OK. Tell you what. Talk to your wife and call me back at 3:00, no  make it 3:15 this afternoon. JOHN: Yes. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  116

CLAUDE: That's all my schedule will allow. I'm sorry. It's going to have to be  3:15 sharp. Can we do that? JOHN: Yes, I'll do that.  CLAUDE: We will talk about it and if we can work something out, wonderful. If  not, we will call it a day. JOHN: OK. CLAUDE: Thank you. Talking to a Potential Buyer - “Subject To” Deal with Financing KAREN: Hi, I'm calling about the house you have. Can you tell me about it? CLAUDE: Yeah. It's $150,000. It's worth about $185,000. You've got to fix it up  and put $10,000 in, but you don't need to go to the bank as you can assume it. It's  in a land sale contract. KAREN: So, would you be willing to carry the loan? CLAUDE: What do you mean by 'carry the loan'? KAREN: Well, I mean… My husband and I are investors and we are new to this.  I've been looking in that area, but I haven't really come across anything that works  yet. I was wondering what the price is. Can we pay our mortgage directly to you?  CLAUDE: Let's pretend that I could do all of those things, what would happen  next?  KAREN: I would definitely want to look at it.  CLAUDE: OK. And then? Let's pretend that you like it. KAREN: I need to talk to my husband about it because he is going to have to do all  of the work on it. CLAUDE: And if it was work, he could do it? KAREN: If it was work, he could do it. CLAUDE: What?  KAREN: I think we would want to buy it. CLAUDE: You think, or… I mean is this what you are looking for? KAREN: Well, I haven't seen the house yet. How can I … CLAUDE: Let's pretend that you like it. It's the sweetest little white picket fence  house in the world.  KAREN: If I like it, I would buy it. HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  117

## Page 118

CLAUDE: What? KAREN: If I like it, I would buy it. CLAUDE: I'm having a hearing problem today. It's the altitude. You wouldn't  have any money to put down as a commitment towards this home, would you? KAREN: Since we would have to be putting a lot of money into it, probably not a  whole lot.  CLAUDE: What do you mean by 'not a whole lot'?  KAREN: You know, a couple of thousand dollars. CLAUDE: You mean five or six? KAREN: I don't think we could come up with that much. CLAUDE: We've got a problem. I can't do this deal for less than $5,000 up-front. KAREN: Oh, wow! What if I could put down $2,000 now and $2,000 later? Can  we do installments? CLAUDE: What if I said $2000 down and $1000 per month for 3 months secured  and paid by a credit or debit card? What would you say? KAREN: OK, we can do that. ROLE-PLAY - “IT’S OVER” CLAUDE: So, John it sounds like you're interested in the house. Do we want to set  up a meeting?  JOHN: Yes.  CLAUDE: To take a look at it?  JOHN: Yes.  CLAUDE: When would you like to meet at the house?  JOHN: How about tomorrow night?  CLAUDE: That is going to be really tough, my wife and I have previous plans. Is  there any chance we could meet today?  JOHN: I work at Quiznos and I've got to be there until at least 4:00.  CLAUDE: Okay, could we meet at 5:30?  JOHN: Yeah, okay, I think I can make that.  CLAUDE: Do you think or do you know?  JOHN: Yeah, okay I will make it.  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  118

CLAUDE: Okay, great. Let me ask you something. If this was a house you liked,  are you the only person who makes the decision?  JOHN: It’s just me.  CLAUDE: Okay, you mind if we talk about money for a minute?  JOHN: No, that's fine.  CLAUDE: Do you want to purchase this house or do this as a rent-to-own?  JOHN: I would like to do a rent-to-own.  CLAUDE: Okay, great. Could you share with me, in round numbers, what kind of  budget you have, what kind of money you could put down as a commitment towards this property?  JOHN: I could come up with $150 in about a week or so.  CLAUDE: That is wonderful John, but there is no point in us meeting or discussing this further.  JOHN: I would really like to have the house.  CLAUDE: Did you really think you were going to get into a house for $150?  JOHN: Well, I can come up with more when I get my next paycheck.  CLAUDE: What do you mean by more, John?  JOHN: I think over the next month, I could come up with about $700.  CLAUDE: Well, gee, if you threw in a sandwich, maybe I'd consider it. No, I'm  kidding.  JOHN: I understand.  CLAUDE: John, how old are you?  JOHN: About 40.  CLAUDE: 40. You've been renting all of your life?  JOHN: Actually, I have been living with my grandmother for the last two years.  CLAUDE: Why am I not surprised? John, we can't do business. I need a minimum  of $5,000 or this conversation is over.  JOHN: Well, I guess I won't be able to do it then. CLAUDE: Exactly.      HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  119

G.U.T.S. and Creative Real Estate Now that we’ve gone over the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©, I want to talk about  how this system can be put to use in your Creative Real Estate business.  When I mentor people in Lease Purchasing, I specifically tell them that  there are two things we have to do. We have to find buyers and we have to  find sellers. We have to find property owners or landlords and we have to  find tenant-buyers. We also have to work smart with these people. We  have to qualify them so we are not wasting our time with tire kickers. Usually our first point of contact with tenant-buyers, the buyers or the renters, is on the phone. What many of us did in the old days was to meet with  these people at a coffee shop or for breakfast or lunch. We would go to the  property and show it to them or we might have spent a great deal of time  on multiple phones calls, giving away a lot of free information. Those days  are over with the G.U.T.S. Sales Method. I can tell you frankly that I did it  the old world way; I spent a lot of time with people even though I did not  have a clue about their needs, about the money available to satisfy those  needs, their urgency, their time frame, or how they made commitments. With the tenant-buyer, for instance, the quick key question is: Why is he  looking for a property? You may want to think ahead of time what questions you need to ask, what you need to know about a prospective buyer in  order to do business. My nickname, by the way. is “One Call Close  Claude”. Why? Because in one phone call I can determine if this is a  tenant-buyer with whom I can do business or if I should politely get off the  phone quickly. What you want to do ahead of time is think about the questions you need to  ask in order to determine whether or not you can do business with this person. Take a fresh piece of paper and write down those questions. Let’s  talk about a few of them. Why are you looking to get into a property? Why  don’t you continue renting? Remember when we talked about negative  and positive redirection? When you go in the opposite direction the prospect expects you to, if you do this correctly, your prospect will do the presentation for you. They’ll tell you why they are looking for a property, what  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  120

## Page 121

their sense of urgency is, what their time frame is. They’ll tell you everything you need to know. Your prospect will do the work for you if you ask  your questions, you redirect your questions, in a positive or negative way.  Remember, the prospects expect you to be forthcoming with your answers.  You might just want to turn their questions into your questions and even go  in the opposite direction from what they expect of you. So you should write  down questions like: Why are you looking for a house? When did you want to move? Do you have a budget? Do you want to spend the same amount for rent or more? How much money can you put down? What stopped you from just going out and buying your own property  right now?  Why are we talking today, Mr. Prospect? Can you imagine being able to get all of this information up-front, if you  were a mind reader, if you were Kreskin? If you could read the mind of  your prospect you would know that maybe they didn’t have any money to  do a deal. Maybe they weren’t planning to move for at least six months.  Maybe they can’t make any other decisions unless they have their partner  or spouse available. Wouldn’t it be great to read their mind and know this  all up-front before you spend countless hours giving away free information?  Wouldn’t it be great to be a mind reader? Well we can’t be mind readers, so we have to learn how to ask questions  with finesse, to redirect questions, to get the information we need up-front. I  want you to think about the questions to ask and practice a little. When  someone asks you a question, turn their question into a question so that  you learn to work smart with your prospective tenant-buyers. If your tenantbuyer doesn’t qualify, get as much information as possible and add it into  your database. Maybe set up a tickler file so you call them back at another  date. But know right up-front it is not worth getting in your car; it’s not  worth mailing tons of literature. It’s not worth meeting them and waiting  around and giving tours of houses. This is the difference between someHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  121

one who can make a very high six or seven figure income and someone  who is just spinning their wheels like a gerbil in a cage. Eventually the  wheelspinners get frustrated from all of the rejection and quit. Learn to  work smart and remember, you have a right to ask questions of your prospective tenant-buyer.  Let’s change gears and talk about the seller or the landlord of a property  that we’re looking to control and do business with. What are the questions  we need to ask the owner of the property?  Why are you selling the home? What are you willing to get for the home? How did you get to the price of the home? Would you be willing to let me rent your home and buy it sometime in  the future? Can we work together if there is a way we can move your home in the  next 30 days for the top sales price without paying a real estate  commission? (If you’re not a realtor.) These are the questions you want to have in your head when speaking to  the owner. You should ask them, once again, with finesse. Ask them in  such a way that you’re not giving information, you’re getting information.  You want to find out if this seller is motivated. On a one to ten scale, what  is their need level? Are they living in the house or is the house vacant?  Why are they selling the house? Are they moving? Are they being transferred? Are they building a larger home? Is it a family situation? Why do  they have this house for sale or for rent? You need this hard information  up-front so that you can determine how you can do business. Which strategy will you use? Will you use lease purchasing? Are you going to do a  sandwich with this person? Are you going to do an assignment? Are you  going to do a land sale contract? If you’re a realtor, how are you going to  list the property? Is the listing commission a question here? Do they want  6% or are they willing to do it for 3%? These are the questions you need to  ask. Your competition is going to jump in and because they’re so glad to get a  prospect in front of them, they’re going to just give it all away. They’re going  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  122

## Page 123

to give a presentation. They’re going to do their Power Point Million Dollar  slide show. You, on the other hand, are going to sound like a doctor. You’re  going to ask questions so you can do your diagnosis and determine if this  is a prospect you can do business with or someone to get away from very  quickly. Remember, ‘no’ is a great answer if you get it early. You don’t want  to get a ‘no’ after investing hours or days or months on a prospective deal.  Isn’t it better to get a ‘no’ up-front? So I’ve discussed buyers, sellers, landlords and what kind of questions we  need to ask using the G.U.T.S. Selling Method. When I mentor people, I  talk about multiple streams of income. I talk about consulting with people.  I also talk about selling products. We use the exact same method. I often  get someone in another state or country who is interested in Creative Real  Estate or lease purchasing and they’re ready to ask me a lot of questions.  In the old days, I used to spend hours on the phone answering all of their  questions. Then one day my wife heard me giving away all this free information and really gave it to me. She said, You were willing to pay the price,  why don’t you make your prospects pay the price? From that one idea  from my wife, I discovered there is a different way to do real estate. I could  ask the questions to qualify the prospect and I can consult with people.  Many of you have spent a lot of time and money on education and doing  deals. You don’t have to give it all away. You can consult with people. You  can get paid for your time, knowledge and energy, but here again, you have  to qualify that prospect. What are their needs? How urgent are their  needs? What is their time frame? Do they have money available to pay  you? How do they make decisions for paying for consultants as well as for  products? I sell a great deal of products, really good informational products  like the one you are reading now. And I’ll ask people what they’re looking  to accomplish, what their budget is. Not everybody is willing to pay for a  consultant or a mentor. They don’t have the money available right now,  but maybe they want to spend a smaller amount on informational products.  It’s better for me to learn that up-front than to be investing an hour or two  with someone who can’t afford a consultant. So, no matter what aspect of  Creative Real Estate you do, whether you are doing sandwiches, assigning, buying properties, foreclosures, selling products, consulting or coachHOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  123

ing your clients, you need to use the G.U.T.S. Sales Method© to be successful. Sales is the Million Dollar Skill and it is necessary for success. I’ve been mentoring and teaching people for years. I’ve had marvelous  people who really took their studies seriously. They learned the strategies.  They knew the different ways of doing Creative Real Estate, not just lease  purchasing, my favorite, but other strategies. Here’s the sad fact, they still  fail. You know why? Because no one ever taught them how to sell, how to  market or how to negotiate. No one ever taught them that sales is not just  about going out and giving away free information. It’s about working smart,  feeling good about yourself, having high self-esteem, asking the questions  and moving from step-to-step in an organized, methodical way. This is the  way you become successful in Creative Real Estate.       HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  124

The Last Word We are coming to the end. I’m going to tell you about myself and the web  page where you can get more information on this innovative method. I’ll tell  you how to contact me if you’d like to learn more about the G.U.T.S. Selling  Method. First, if you’d like more information, I suggest you go to my web  page. It’s www.claudediamond.com. I also have newsletters with articles on the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©. I have  a ton of free information for you. I also have a free ebook on the G.U.T.S.  Sales Method© which you can download right from the web page. If you’d  like to learn more about G.U.T.S., we also have a Mentor Training program  where I would personally train you. I have yet to meet someone who does  not substantially increase their sales in Creative Real Estate or whatever  sales they’re in as a result of the G.U.T.S. Sales Method©. It’s a marvelous  method. It allows you to have a blank check for the rest of your life, no  matter what product or service you’re involved with. I’ve worked a long  time to get to the financial freedom that my family and I now enjoy. We live  in different parts of the country, in the mountains of Colorado and by the  beach in San Diego. We have a wonderful life, we’re debt free. We make  a wonderful income, we have financial security. It’s all about learning how  to give good phone and knowing a sales method that puts you in control, so  that you feel good about yourself.  I have one caveat here. This is a tough method. This is going to take practice. My mentor used to say, Claude, everybody wants to be rich, but few  are willing to pay the price. The price of success, of financial freedom, is  finding a method that works. But, you are going to have to put time into  this. This is not intuitive. When you were in school, you were told that  when a teacher asked you a question, you had to answer the question.  Now along comes Claude, and he’s telling you, Don’t answer questions  asked of you, redirect them into other questions because that’s your right.  This is going to take time. This is going to take practice. But I can assure  you that this is the way to success. Sales is the Million Dollar Skill. You  would not be reading this today, I would not be making the income and having the freedom and the wonderful lifestyle that I enjoy today if it wasn’t for  HOW TO SELL WITH G.U.T.S.™  125
