# The 3D Decision Grid

## Overview

The 3D Decision Grid is a proprietary decision-making framework developed by David Mentor to help executives and leaders make better strategic choices aligned with their values and purpose. This structured approach evaluates decisions across three dimensions: Direction, Duty, and Development.

## Core Concept

Most decision-making frameworks focus primarily on financial outcomes or immediate consequences. The 3D Grid expands evaluation to include alignment with personal calling, ethical considerations, and long-term growth potential.

## The Three Dimensions

### 1. Direction
*Does this decision align with your calling and move you toward your vision?*

- **Purpose Alignment**: How well the option connects to higher levels of your Purpose Pyramid
- **Vision Advancement**: Degree to which the choice moves you toward your 3-5 year vision
- **Mission Fulfillment**: How directly it contributes to your primary work
- **Strategic Congruence**: Alignment with existing strategic priorities

### 2. Duty
*Does this decision honor your responsibilities and values?*

- **Value Consistency**: Alignment with your core values and principles
- **Ethical Clarity**: Moral and ethical considerations beyond mere legality
- **Stakeholder Impact**: Effects on all parties with legitimate interests
- **Stewardship**: Responsible use of resources (time, talent, treasure)
- **Biblical Alignment**: Consistency with scriptural principles and wisdom

### 3. Development
*Does this decision foster growth and create positive long-term impact?*

- **Personal Growth**: Opportunities for learning and character development
- **Team/Organizational Development**: How it builds capacity in others
- **Sustainability**: Long-term viability beyond immediate results
- **Legacy Potential**: Lasting impact beyond your direct involvement
- **Multiplication Effect**: How benefits might expand to others

## Application Methodology

### Step 1: Frame the Decision
- Clearly identify the specific choice to be made
- Define available options (typically 2-5 alternatives)
- Establish decision parameters and constraints

### Step 2: Score Each Dimension
For each option, score the following dimensions on a 1-10 scale:

| Option | Direction | Duty | Development | Total |
|--------|-----------|------|-------------|-------|
| A      | ?         | ?    | ?           | ?     |
| B      | ?         | ?    | ?           | ?     |
| C      | ?         | ?    | ?           | ?     |

### Step 3: Apply Weighted Analysis
Not all dimensions may have equal importance for every decision:
- Assign percentage weights to each dimension based on context
- Calculate weighted scores
- Compare totals while remaining sensitive to significant variation in any dimension

### Step 4: Identify Improvement Opportunities
- Can any option be modified to improve its score?
- Are there hybrid approaches that combine strengths?
- What mitigations would address weaknesses in otherwise strong options?

### Step 5: Discernment and Decision
- Numerical scores inform but don't dictate the final choice
- Pray for wisdom and clarity
- Seek counsel from trusted advisors
- Make the decision with confidence in the process

## Red Flags in the Grid

Consider pausing or reconsidering when:
- Any option scores below 5 on any dimension
- There's more than a 3-point disparity between dimensions for a single option
- The highest scoring option causes significant internal resistance
- All options score poorly across multiple dimensions (may need to create new alternatives)

## Biblical Foundation

The 3D Decision Grid draws from several scriptural principles:
- Seeking wisdom and counsel (Proverbs 15:22)
- Considering the impact on others (Philippians 2:3-4)
- Long-term vs. short-term thinking (Proverbs 21:5)
- Applying values to choices (Joshua 24:15)
- Stewardship responsibility (Luke 16:10-12)

## Case Study: Manufacturing Expansion Decision

### Context
A manufacturing company needed to decide whether to:
A) Expand existing facility
B) Open a second location
C) Acquire a competitor
D) Maintain current operations with efficiency improvements

### 3D Grid Analysis

| Option | Direction (40%) | Duty (30%) | Development (30%) | Weighted Total |
|--------|----------------|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| A      | 7 (2.8)        | 8 (2.4)    | 6 (1.8)           | 7.0           |
| B      | 9 (3.6)        | 7 (2.1)    | 9 (2.7)           | 8.4           |
| C      | 6 (2.4)        | 5 (1.5)    | 7 (2.1)           | 6.0           |
| D      | 4 (1.6)        | 9 (2.7)    | 4 (1.2)           | 5.5           |

### Decision Outcome
After applying the 3D Grid, Option B (opening a second location) scored highest with notable strengths in both Direction and Development dimensions. 

The company implemented this choice with specific modifications to address Duty concerns:
- Established clear advancement paths for existing employees
- Created relocation support for team members interested in the new location
- Developed strong community engagement plan for the new location

### Five-Year Results
- 42% revenue growth
- Improved leadership development as managers took ownership of locations
- Reduced operational risk through geographic diversification
- Created two distinctive cultures united by shared core values

## Variations and Applications

### Executive Team Adaptation
For leadership teams, each member scores options independently, then results are compiled to reveal consensus and divergence.

### Rapid Decision Model
For time-sensitive decisions, a simplified version focuses on just 2-3 key factors per dimension.

### Family Decision Variant
Modified version for family choices like relocations, major purchases, or lifestyle changes.

### Non-Profit Application
Adapted to include mission impact, donor stewardship, and community benefit dimensions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Predetermining outcome**: Manipulating scores to justify a preferred choice
2. **Overweighting financial factors**: Allowing monetary concerns to dominate all dimensions
3. **Neglecting Duty**: Undervaluing ethical and values-based considerations
4. **Short-term bias**: Failing to adequately consider long-term Development implications
5. **Binary thinking**: Seeing options as either/or rather than seeking creative alternatives

## Integration with Other Frameworks

The 3D Decision Grid works in conjunction with:
- **Purpose Pyramid**: Provides foundation for Direction dimension
- **Stewardship Matrix**: Informs resource allocation aspects of the Duty dimension
- **Legacy Leadership Model**: Connects to Development dimension priorities

## Implementation Guide

1. Print the grid template for important decisions
2. Score collaboratively when decisions affect multiple stakeholders
3. Document reasoning behind scores for future reference
4. Review past decisions quarterly to refine scoring accuracy
5. Create decision database to improve pattern recognition and future choices
