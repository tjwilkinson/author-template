## Pyramid Levels (Bottom to Top)

### 1. GOALS (Base)
- Specific, measurable objectives
- Typically 90-day to 1-year time horizons
- Should be challenging but achievable
- Examples: Launch new product, increase sales by 20%, onboard 5 new team members

### 2. VISION
- Future-oriented view of desired outcomes
- 3-5 year perspective
- What success looks like when goals are achieved consistently
- Examples: Leading organization in sector, creating industry-changing innovation, building a self-managing team

### 3. VALUES
- Core principles that guide decisions and behavior
- Non-negotiable standards
- Filters for opportunity assessment
- Biblical principles that inform character and choices
- Examples: Excellence, integrity, stewardship, service, family

### 4. MISSION
- The primary work you're called to do
- Combines your unique gifts with marketplace needs
- May evolve over seasons of life but remains consistent
- Examples: "To equip business leaders with biblical principles for sustainable success" or "To create technology that enhances human connection"

### 5. CALLING (Peak)
- Ultimate purpose given by God
- Transcends specific roles or organizations
- Connects daily work to eternal impact
- Example: "To help others discover and develop their God-given potential"

## Application Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current alignment between daily activities and higher levels
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify disconnects between levels
3. **Realignment**: Make strategic changes to create congruence
4. **Decision Filter**: Use the pyramid to evaluate new opportunities
5. **Regular Review**: Revisit quarterly to maintain alignment

## Biblical Foundation

The Purpose Pyramid integrates several scriptural concepts:
- Stewardship of talents (Matthew 25:14-30)
- Running with purpose (1 Corinthians 9:26)
- Planning with God's guidance (Proverbs 16:9)
- Living for eternal impact (Colossians 3:23-24)

## Common Misalignments

1. **Inverted Pyramid**: When goals drive values instead of values driving goals
2. **Missing Middle**: Clear calling and goals but no connecting mission
3. **Value Conflicts**: Goals that contradict stated values
4. **Vision Void**: Tactical excellence without strategic direction
5. **Calling Confusion**: Mistaking career success for purpose fulfillment

## Coaching Questions for Each Level

### Calling
- What would you want to be remembered for at the end of your life?
- How do you believe God is using your life to impact others?
- What themes have remained consistent throughout different seasons?

### Mission
- What unique contribution are you equipped to make?
- Where do your talents meet marketplace needs?
- What work energizes rather than depletes you?

### Values
- What principles would you never compromise, even for success?
- When have you felt most aligned with your core beliefs?
- Which biblical principles most resonate with your approach?

### Vision
- What would "success" look like 3-5 years from now?
- How would your ideal future positively impact others?
- What organizational or team culture are you building toward?

### Goals
- What specific, measurable outcomes would move you toward your vision?
- What habits need to change to achieve these results?
- How will you track progress and maintain accountability?

## Integration with Other Frameworks

The Purpose Pyramid works in conjunction with other tools in David's coaching system:
- **3D Decision Grid**: For evaluating choices against pyramid alignment
- **Stewardship Matrix**: For resource allocation that supports the pyramid
- **Legacy Leadership Model**: For developing influence that flows from purpose

## Implementation Guide

1. Begin with prayer and reflection on calling
2. Work down the pyramid, ensuring each level supports the one above
3. Test alignment with trusted advisors and scripture
4. Create accountability system for maintaining alignment
5. Schedule quarterly reviews to assess and adjust
