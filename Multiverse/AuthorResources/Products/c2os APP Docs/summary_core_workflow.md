# Summary: Core Task Workflow (TRO Inspired - ASCEND Method Daily Execution)

## Stages
1.  **Capture:** Gather all inputs into a central **Inbox**. (Goal: Regular Inbox Zero).
2.  **Triage (Process Inbox Item-by-Item):**
    *   Is it Junk? -> Delete.
    *   Is it Actionable? -> Create **Task** (initially "Unprocessed").
    *   Is it Reference? -> File as **Resource**.
    *   No Action Now/Maybe Later? -> Assign to **Someday/Maybe**.
3.  **Process (Clarify Unprocessed Tasks):**
    *   Define the **very next physical action**.
    *   Multi-step? -> Define as **Project**, determine next action.
    *   < 2 Mins? -> **Do It Now**.
    *   Can Delegate? -> **Delegate** & create **Waiting For** item.
    *   Defer (Do it yourself later):
        *   Record clear Next Step (link to Project if needed).
        *   Add essential Notes.
        *   Schedule: Assign **Do Date** (required - when to see it again), Due Date (optional - hard deadline), Calendar block (optional), Someday/Maybe.
        *   Assign **Contexts** (required - `@Computer`, `@Home`, etc.).
4.  **Review (Previewing - Regular Cadence):**
    *   **Daily:** Check Calendar, Process Hotlist (tasks nearing Do/Due date), Validate/Adjust "Do Today" list.
    *   **Weekly:** Scan "Weekly Review List" (upcoming items without hard dates) & re-process as needed. Integrate with 12WY Review.
    *   **Monthly:** Review Someday/Maybe list, promote or delete items.
5.  **Do:** Execute the planned Next Actions based on Context and "Do Today" list.
6.  **Done:** Mark tasks complete.

## Key Concepts
*   **Next Action Focus:** Tasks describe immediate physical steps.
*   **Contexts:** Essential for filtering actionable tasks based on location/tool.
*   **Do Dates:** Primary scheduling mechanism (when to resurface/consider).
*   **Waiting For:** Tracking delegated items.
