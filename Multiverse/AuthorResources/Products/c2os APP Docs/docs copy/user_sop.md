Welcome aboard! Let's get you set up for success.

*   **Navigation:** Familiarize yourself with the main areas:
    *   **Inbox:** Your central collection point for incoming tasks and ideas.

    *   **Goals:** (Pro) Define and track your strategic objectives.
    *   **Contexts:** View tasks filtered by the tool, location, or person needed.

## 4. Mastering Your Workflow: From Chaos to Clarity (TRO in Action)

This is the core engine of your productivity. Follow these steps consistently to transform how you manage your tasks and information.

### Step 1: Capture Everything - Free Your Mind

**The Benefit:** Stop juggling mental notes and worrying about forgetting things. A clear mind is a focused mind.

*   **How-To:** Use the Inbox as your universal capture tool. Anytime a task, idea, reminder, or piece of information comes to mind or arrives (email, meeting, etc.), add it quickly to your [App Name] Inbox. Don't worry about organizing it yet – just get it captured.

### Step 2: Clarify & Process - Decide with Confidence

**The Benefit:** Eliminate ambiguity and procrastination triggers by making clear decisions about every item you've captured. Aim for "Inbox Zero" regularly.

*   **How-To:** Process items in your Inbox one by one, from the top down. For each item, ask:
    *   **Is it Actionable?**
        *   **No:**
            *   **Trash it:** If it's no longer needed.
            *   **Reference it:** File it away for potential future use (e.g., in Notes/Resources).
            *   **Incubate it (Someday/Maybe):** If it's something you might want to do later, but not now. Assign it to the 'Someday/Maybe' list.
        *   **Yes:** Proceed below.
    *   **What's the very next physical action required?**
        *   **Multi-step?** Define it as a **Project**. Give the project a clear desired outcome. Then, determine the *single, very next physical action* required to move the project forward.
        *   **Single-step?** Clarify the single action needed.
    *   **Can it be done in 2 minutes or less? (The 2-Minute Rule)**
        *   **Yes:** **Do it immediately!** Get that quick win and clear it from your list.
        *   **No:** Proceed below.
    *   **Can/Should it be delegated?**
        *   **Yes:** **Delegate it.** Assign it to the appropriate person within [App Name] (if they use it) or track it externally. Create a 'Waiting For' task for yourself to follow up.
        *   **No:** **Defer it** (meaning you'll do it yourself, but later). Proceed to Organize.

### Step 3: Organize for Action - Set Yourself Up for Success

**The Benefit:** Ensure your actionable tasks are sorted logically, allowing you to find and engage with the right work at the right time and place.

*   **How-To (For deferred actions you will do):**
    *   **Assign Contexts:** Tag the action with the location, tool, or person required (e.g., `@Computer`, `@Office`, `@Phone`, `@Agenda-Sarah`). This allows you to see relevant tasks when you are in that context. *A primary context is required.*
    *   **Link to Project:** If the action is part of a larger project, link it to that project.
    *   **Schedule Wisely:**
        *   **Do Date (Defer Date):** *Required.* When do you want to *see* or consider this task again? This is your primary scheduling tool for focus.
        *   **Due Date (Deadline):** *Optional.* Use only for tasks with real-world, external deadlines with consequences.
        *   **Calendar:** *Optional.* Block specific time on your calendar for tasks that require a dedicated slot (e.g., appointments, focused work blocks >30 mins).
    *   **Move to Lists:** The action should now move from the Inbox to the appropriate list (e.g., a 'Next Actions' list filtered by context, or a project support list).

### Step 4: Reflect & Align - Stay on Course

**The Benefit:** Maintain control and perspective. Ensure your system is current, complete, and aligned with your priorities and goals. Avoid dropping balls and reactively fighting fires.

*   **How-To: The Weekly Review (Essential Habit)**
    *   Block out time each week (e.g., Friday afternoon).
    *   **Get Clear:** Process your Inboxes (physical and digital) to zero.
    *   **Get Current:** Review your 'Next Actions' lists, Project lists, 'Waiting For' list, and 'Someday/Maybe' list. Mark completed items, update tasks, and migrate forward actions.
    *   **Get Creative:** Review your Goals. Brainstorm any new projects or actions needed. Check your Someday/Maybe list for items to activate.
    *   *(Specific Weekly Review steps/checklist might be built into the app later)*

### Step 5: Engage with Purpose - Do What Matters

**The Benefit:** Execute your priorities with confidence, knowing you are working on the right things based on your context, time, and energy levels.

*   **How-To:** Choose your work consciously:
    *   **By Context:** When you're `@Computer`, pull up your `@Computer` list. When you're running errands, check your `@Errands` list.
    *   **By Date:** Review tasks scheduled for today (Do Date or Due Date). Check your Calendar for time-specific commitments.
    *   **By Priority/Goal:** When you have focused time, tackle the next actions for your most important projects or goals.
