# Project Plan: `Cadence Cornerstone OS` Cloud & Mobile App

*Version: Reflecting Hybrid User/Tenant Model & Feature Expansion*

## 1. Project Vision & Methodology

**Vision:** To create a comprehensive cloud and mobile application for personal and business productivity, integrating goal achievement, task management, habit formation, and knowledge management. **`Cadence Cornerstone OS`** (the Application) will empower individual users, facilitate team collaboration within organizations, and serve as a powerful platform for coaches to manage and guide their clients, with full white-labeling capabilities.

**Methodology (Integrated):** This application implements the **`ASCEND Method`**, a unique operational system synthesizing principles from:

*   **Total Relaxed Organization (TRO):** Provides the core daily workflow for capture, triage, processing, review, and execution (part of Structure, Commit, Evaluate).
*   **Tony Robbins (RPM):** Structures goal setting around Results, Purpose, and MAP (part of Align, Structure).
*   **Darren Hardy (Compound Effect):** Emphasizes consistent small actions and tracking (part of Commit, Nurture, Evaluate).
*   **The 12 Week Year (12WY):** Implements a high-urgency execution framework with cycles, tactics, and scoring (part of Align, Structure, Commit, Evaluate).
*   **RACI:** Incorporates principles for defining team roles (relevant for collaboration features within Structure/Commit).
*   **(Underlying Philosophy):** Supports the journey towards the **AIÂ³ Framework's** "Autonomous Identity" by facilitating "Automate Action" and reinforcing "Inspired Integrity" through the Align stage.

## 2. Core Features

*   **Hybrid User Model:** Supports Individual Users (Free/Pro plans) and Tenant Members (invited into Organizations/Coaching practices). Users can exist independently and/or belong to tenants.
*   **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Securely isolates data *within* specific tenant contexts, while allowing user-level data and controlled sharing/delegation/connections between users/tenants.
*   **White-Labeling:** Allows tenants (e.g., coaching clients, businesses) to customize branding (logo, colors, app name) for their members.
*   **Google Sign-In:** Primary authentication method for all users.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
    *   Standard Tenant Admin/User roles.
    *   Tenant Admins can create custom roles with granular permissions within their tenant.
    *   Permissions control access to features and data within personal and tenant contexts.
*   **Goal Management (RPM & 12WY):**
    *   Define long-term Visions/Purpose (Personal or Company scope).
    *   Structure work in 12-Week Cycles.
    *   Define measurable 12-Week Goals (Results - Personal or Company scope).
    *   Plan specific Weekly Tactics required for goals.
*   **Task Management (TRO):**
    *   Full task lifecycle (Inbox, Triage, Processed, WaitingFor, Done, SomedayMaybe).
    *   Quick Capture (Mobile, Web, Email Forwarding - future).
    *   Processing includes Next Actions, Contexts, Do Dates, Due Dates.
    *   Project linking.
    *   Flexible Recurring Task options.
*   **Project Management:** Define multi-step projects (Personal or Company scope) linked to goals.
*   **Team Collaboration:**
    *   Define Teams within a tenant.
    *   Assign RACI roles to Users or Teams for Projects/Tasks within a tenant context.
    *   Visibility of linked Notes/Resources controlled by RACI assignments.
    *   Company-scoped Goals/Projects visible within the tenant.
    *   (Optional) Shared Contexts/Tags at tenant level.
    *   (Optional) @Mentions in comments.
*   **User-to-User Delegation:** Individual users (paid plan) can delegate specific tasks to *any* other user (including free users), managing status and access level.
*   **Coach-Client Connection:**
    *   Individual users (paid plan) can securely connect with a Coach (user within a 'Coaching' type tenant).
    *   Grants the Coach permission-based visibility into the client's personal goals, tasks, trackers, and reviews.
    *   In-app commenting/feedback mechanisms between coach and client (on goals, reviews, etc.).
*   **Coaching Platform Features:**
    *   Coach Dashboard: Overview of connected clients' progress and engagement metrics.
    *   Templating Engine: Coaches create reusable templates for Goals, Projects, Trackers.
*   **Knowledge Management:**
    *   Capture Notes/Resources (Personal or Tenant scope).
    *   Link Notes/Resources to Tasks/Projects/Goals.
    *   (Advanced) Bi-Directional Linking (`[[links]]`) between items.
*   **Custom Trackers (Compound Effect):** Define and track custom metrics (numeric, yes/no, scale) with visualization (charts, streaks). Link trackers to goals.
*   **Weekly Planning & Review (12WY):** Guided routines to plan the week based on Tactics, review progress, and calculate a Weekly Execution Score. Option to submit reviews to a connected coach.
*   **Google Calendar Integration:** Two-way sync for time blocking and viewing scheduled tasks/events.
*   **GoHighLevel Integration:** Tenant subscription status managed in GHL, automatically activating/deactivating tenant features/access in the app via webhooks.
*   **Dashboard:** Personalized overview (Cycle progress, execution score, upcoming items, tracker summary).
*   **Guided Onboarding:** Help users understand the methodology and app features.
*   **Mobile App:** Optimized for quick capture and core workflows.

## 3. Architecture Overview

*   **Backend:** (Suggest Technology - e.g., Node.js/Python/Go, PostgreSQL/MySQL database)
*   **Frontend:** (Suggest Technology - e.g., React/Vue/Angular for Web, React Native/Flutter for Mobile)
*   **Cloud Platform:** (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure)
*   **Key Patterns:** Multi-tenancy support with user-centric data model, RBAC, Secure OAuth handling (Google Sign-In, Google Calendar), Webhook processing (GHL), API-driven design.

## 4. Database Schema Concept

The database structure evolves to support the hybrid model:

*   `tenants`: Stores organization details, white-label settings, `ghl_identifier`, `tenant_type` ('Business', 'Coaching'), `owner_user_id`.
*   `users`: Stores global user details, `google_id`, `plan_type` ('Free', 'IndividualPro', etc.).
*   `tenant_memberships`: Links users to tenants, defines user's role *within that tenant*.
*   `permissions`: System-defined actions.
*   `roles`: Tenant-specific roles (standard and custom).
*   `role_permissions`: Links permissions to roles per tenant.
*   `user_roles` (Replaced by `tenant_memberships` which includes role).
*   `visions`, `twelve_week_cycles`, `twelve_week_goals`, `weekly_tactics`, `projects`, `tasks`, `notes_resources`: Include `created_by_user_id` and `context_tenant_id` (nullable, indicates if item belongs to a tenant or is personal), `scope` ('personal', 'company').
*   `contexts`: User-defined contexts.
*   `task_contexts`: Links tasks to contexts.
*   `project_raci_assignments`, `task_raci_assignments`: Link users/teams to tenant-context items with RACI roles.
*   `teams`, `team_memberships`: (If implementing team assignments).
*   `task_delegations`: Manages user-to-user task assignment.
*   `coach_client_links`: Manages connections between coaches and clients, defining permissions.
*   `trackers`, `tracker_entries`: User-scoped custom tracking.
*   `weekly_reviews`: User-scoped, potentially visible to connected coach.
*   `(Potentially others: invitations, templates, comments, etc.)`

## 5. Implementation Checklist (MVP-First Approach)

*   [x] **Environment:** Implement secrets management strategy (e.g., Vercel env variables, Supabase Vault if applicable). (Added Supabase keys to Vercel envs: Prod, Preview, Dev)
*   [ ] Set up basic monitoring, logging, and error tracking (e.g., Vercel Analytics, Sentry/equivalent placeholder).

**Database Architecture (Design with End in Mind):**
*   [x] **Local DB:** Set up local PostgreSQL instance. (via Homebrew `postgresql@14` service)
*   [x] **Migration Tool:** Choose and initialize a migration tool (e.g., Prisma Migrate, Supabase migrations). (Supabase Migrations initialized, configured for local Homebrew PG in `supabase/config.toml`)
*   [x] **Schema Design (Core):** Design initial ERD focusing on core entities: Users, Tenants, TenantMemberships, Roles, Permissions (considering hybrid user/tenant model from the start). (Defined in initial migration)

*   [x] **Schema Design (Docs):** Document schema decisions and initial ERD. (In `docs/api-structure.md`)
*   [x] **Initial Schema (Core):** Create initial migration files for these core tables using the chosen migration tool. (`supabase/migrations/20250405033910_initial_schema.sql`)
*   [ ] **Schema Design (Inbox - Phase 2):** Design schema for `inbox` table (capture source, content, processed status).
*   [ ] **Schema Design (Notes - Phase 2):** Design schema for `notes` table (content, links, source).
*   [ ] **Schema Design (Projects - Phase 2):** Design schema for `projects` table (goal link, status, etc.).
*   [ ] **Schema Design (Contexts - Phase 2):** Design schema for `contexts` table (`id`, `name`, `user_id` nullable FK, `context_tenant_id` nullable FK) and `task_contexts` linking table.
*   [ ] **Schema Design (Future):** Consider placeholders/ideas for `tags`, `areas` (e.g., for PARA) tables and their linking tables.

**Core System Architecture:**
*   [x] **Database Implementation:** Apply initial schema migration to local DB. (Applied via `supabase start` to local Docker DB)
*   [x] **Authentication:** Configure Supabase Auth (Google Sign-In primary, possibly email/password fallback). (Google Provider enabled in Supabase dashboard, credentials added to Vercel envs & local `.env` needed)
*   [x] **Authentication:** Implement basic Google Sign-In flow in the Next.js app shell. (`AuthButton.tsx`, `/api/auth/callback`, `page.tsx`)
*   [x] **Authentication:** Set up basic user session management (e.g., using Supabase Auth helpers in Next.js). (`@supabase/ssr` clients, `middleware.ts`)
*   [x] **API:** Set up basic Next.js API route structure in `apps/web` (e.g., `/api/auth`, `/api/webhooks`). Define initial API versioning strategy (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
*   [x] **Frontend Shell:** Create basic Next.js app structure (`/app` router recommended). (Done via `create-next-app`)

*   [ ] **White-Labeling:** Implement placeholder/basic mechanism concept (e.g., reading config based on hostname/tenant).
*   [x] **GHL:** Define structure/placeholders for GHL webhook handling API endpoint (e.g., `/api/webhooks/ghl`).

**Milestone:** Foundational code structure exists in Git, local dev environment runnable, basic auth connects to Supabase, initial DB schema designed and migration created.

**Running the Local Environment:**
1. Start Supabase services: `npx supabase start`
2. Apply migrations (if needed): `npx supabase db push` (for local changes) or `npx supabase migration up` (for new migrations)
3. Start the web server (from `apps/web` directory): `npm run dev`
