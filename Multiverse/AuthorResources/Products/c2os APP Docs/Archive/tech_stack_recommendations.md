# Tech Stack Recommendations for Second Brain App

Based on the requirements derived from productivity systems research (Ultimate Brain, PPV, and TRO), this document outlines the recommended technology stack for developing a second brain application with both web and mobile versions.

## Frontend (Web)
- **React.js with TypeScript** - For type-safe, component-based UI development
- **Next.js** - For server-side rendering, optimized performance, and better SEO
- **TailwindCSS** - For efficient, utility-first styling and rapid UI development

## Mobile
- **React Native** - For cross-platform development, allowing code sharing with web version
- **Expo** - For simplified development workflow, testing, and deployment

## Backend
- **Node.js** with Express or Next.js API routes - For JavaScript-based server-side logic
- **PostgreSQL** - For relational database capabilities critical for complex relationships between productivity elements
- **Prisma** - As ORM for type-safe database access and simplified database operations

## State Management
- **React Query** - For server state management and data fetching
- **Zustand** or **Redux Toolkit** - For client-side state management

## Sync & Real-time Capabilities
- **Supabase** or **Firebase** - For real-time database capabilities, authentication, and cloud functions
- Alternative: Custom WebSockets implementation for real-time synchronization

## Deployment
- **Vercel** - For web application hosting and continuous deployment
- **App Store/Google Play** - For mobile app distribution
- **Docker containers** - For backend services if needed

## Rationale
This stack provides:
1. The relational database capabilities needed for complex data relationships (similar to Notion)
2. Robust real-time synchronization across devices
3. Code reuse between web and mobile platforms through the React ecosystem
4. Type safety with TypeScript to reduce bugs
5. Modern, responsive UI capabilities
6. Scalable architecture for future growth

## Key Technical Considerations
- Strong data synchronization capabilities needed for seamless multi-device experience
- Complex relational data model to support hierarchical organization systems
- Offline capabilities for mobile experience
- Performance optimizations for handling large knowledge bases
