# App Workflow: Capture & Triage (Based on TRO)

This outlines the initial stages of processing information within the app, inspired by the Total Relaxed Organization (TRO) Triage Flow Chart.

## 1. Quick Capture Inbox

*   **Purpose:** A central, temporary holding area for *everything* entering the system. Digital equivalent of TRO's "Approved Collection Points".
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Forwarded emails
    *   Quick voice notes (ideally auto-transcribed)
    *   Direct notes (mobile/desktop app)
    *   Thoughts, ideas, reminders
    *   Web clips (articles, URLs)
    *   Documents, images, files
*   **State:** All items are "Unprocessed". Goal is regular inbox zero via Triage.

## 2. Triage Process (Processing the Inbox)

*   **Goal:** Determine what each item *is* and its *next step*. Process items "One Item At A Time From The Top".
*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Is it Junk?**
        *   Any potential future value or required action?
        *   **NO:** Delete/Throw out. -> **DONE with item.**
        *   **YES:** Proceed.

    2.  **Is it Actionable? (Requires doing something?)**
        *   **YES:** It's a **Task**.
            *   Enter into Task List (as "Unprocessed Task"). Define the task briefly.
            *   Further task processing (context, priority, project) happens later.
            *   **"Hot" Items:** Flag as urgent/priority during triage if needed, but still goes to Unprocessed Task List for later detailed processing.
            *   **< 2 Min Communication:** Initially capture as a task. Handle the 2-min rule during later task processing to keep triage fast.
            *   After creating the task -> **DONE with item.**
        *   **NO:** Proceed.

    3.  **Is it Reference Material (Resource)?**
        *   Potentially useful info for supporting tasks/projects, but not actionable now?
        *   **YES:** It's a **Resource**.
            *   File it (Move from Inbox to "Resource" / "Knowledge Base" area).
            *   Assign tags, link to Projects/Areas, or place in folder structure.
            *   -> **DONE with item.**
        *   **NO:** Re-evaluate (likely Junk or needs clarification).

*   **Output:** Quick Capture Inbox is empty. Items are Deleted, logged as Tasks (in Unprocessed Task List), or filed as Resources.
