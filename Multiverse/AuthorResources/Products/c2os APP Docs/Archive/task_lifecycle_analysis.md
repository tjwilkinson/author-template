# Analysis: TRO Lifecycle of a Task Flowchart

This document analyzes the high-level "Lifecycle of a Task" flowchart provided, outlining the core stages of the TRO process within the envisioned app.

## Core Stages:

1.  **Collect:**
    *   **Description:** Getting all inputs (ideas, emails, notes, files, etc.) into the system.
    *   **App Implementation:** Corresponds to the **Quick Capture Inbox** workflow previously defined.

2.  **Process:**
    *   **Description:** Clarifying actionable items (Tasks) that have been identified during the initial Triage.
    *   **Key Activities (from "Re-Process" detail block):**
        *   **Decide Next Step:** Defining the immediate, physical action needed.
        *   **Add Notes:** Recording relevant details and context.
        *   **Schedule:** Assigning Do Dates/Defer Dates (when to see the task) or Due Dates (hard deadlines).
        *   **Assign Contexts:** Tagging the task based on location, tool, or situation needed to perform it (e.g., `@Computer`, `@Phone`, `@Home`).
    *   **Implicit Activities:** Often includes linking the task to a larger **Project** or **Area/Goal**.
    *   **App Implementation:** This stage acts on items moved from the Quick Capture Inbox to the "Unprocessed Tasks List" during Triage.

3.  **Review:**
    *   **Description:** Regularly looking over processed tasks to select what to work on next.
    *   **App Implementation:** Involves viewing filtered task lists (e.g., by context, priority, Do Date) and performing daily/weekly reviews.

4.  **Do:**
    *   **Description:** Executing the defined "Next Step" for a task.
    *   **App Implementation:** The user performs the task outside or inside the app, depending on the action.

5.  **Done:**
    *   **Description:** Marking a task as complete.
    *   **App Implementation:** Functionality to check off or archive completed tasks.

## Key Takeaways:

*   This flowchart provides the overall structure for task management in the app.
*   The "Process" stage is the critical step following initial Triage and needs detailed definition.
*   "Re-Process" emphasizes that task details (Next Step, Notes, Schedule, Context) can be updated as needed.
*   The next step in designing the app workflow is to detail the user interface and logic for the **Process** stage.
