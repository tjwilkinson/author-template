# App Naming, Methodology, and IP Integration Notes

This document summarizes the brainstorming and decisions regarding the application's naming, its core integrated methodology, and the incorporation of existing intellectual property (IP).

## 1. Core Distinction

*   **AI³ Framework:** The overarching personal development and mindset philosophy focused on creating an "Autonomous Identity" through Automate Action, Inspired Integrity, and the core Identity concept. It represents the *goal* and *mindset*.
*   **The Application:** **`Cadence Cornerstone OS`** (C²OS). The practical software tool and operational system designed to help users implement productivity methodologies and build the necessary *habits* and *actions* to support the AI³ journey. It's the *engine* or *platform*, providing the foundational rhythm and structure.
*   **Integrated Methodology:** **`ASCEND Method`**. The specific blend of TRO, RPM, 12WY, CE, and RACI as implemented *within the application's workflow*. (Acronym: Align, Structure, Commit, Evaluate, Nurture, Direct).

## 2. Application Name Final Decision

*   **Final Name:** **`Cadence Cornerstone OS`** (C²OS)
*   **Rationale:** Fits C²OS pattern, emphasizes foundational importance (`Cornerstone`) of rhythm (`Cadence`), includes OS format, subtle Christian link, pairs well with methodology, domain available (`c2os.app`).

## 3. Integrated Methodology Name Final Decision

*   **Final Name:** **`ASCEND Method`**
*   **Rationale:** Acronym (Align, Structure, Commit, Evaluate, Nurture, Direct) captures the core process flow, aspirational feel (climbing, progress), distinct from app name, subtle Christian link, strong marketing potential ("Ascend the success ladder").

## 4. IP Integration Strategy & Ecosystem Context

*   **AI³ Framework:** The guiding philosophy (Mindset).
*   **ASCEND Method:** The core operational methodology (Process) implemented within C²OS.
*   **Cadence Cornerstone OS (C²OS):** The productivity and execution application (Tool).
*   **Cybersuite:** The overarching white-label GoHighLevel platform (Suite/Platform). C²OS will be integrated as a key component *within* Cybersuite, handling the core productivity workflows.
*   **PULSE:** KPI tracking framework, likely implemented *within* C²OS dashboards, potentially pulling data relevant to Cybersuite functions.
*   **SPARK:** Reward/engagement concepts, potentially applied within C²OS coaching features or Cybersuite marketing funnels.
*   **C² (Cashflow Cadence):** A specific program/template to be implemented *within* C²OS.

## 5. Key Feature Implications

*   **Robust Templating System:** Crucial for deploying specific programs (like C²), coaching routines (mindset exercises, visualizations), and methodology variations.
*   **Flexible Task/Checklist System:** Needs to support complex recurring patterns for rituals and habit tracking.
*   **Rich Notes/Journaling:** To support mindset work and reflections.

## 6. Next Steps

*   ~~Finalize App Name and Integrated Methodology Name.~~ (Completed)
*   ~~Verify availability (domain, trademarks, etc.).~~ (Completed for c2os.app)
*   Update `plan.md` and other relevant documents with final names.
*   Incorporate template/program feature prominently in the development plan/roadmap.
*   Ensure database schema supports flexible templates and custom routines.
